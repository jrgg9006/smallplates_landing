# Executive Summary
## Small Plates & Co.

*Version 2.0 — December 2024*

---

## 1. Business Description

Small Plates creates collaborative wedding recipe books where guests contribute their favorite recipes, which are then professionally designed and printed as premium hardcover books for the couple. 

The result is more than a cookbook — it's a meaningful gift that carries the presence of the people who love them into their kitchen, where their marriage actually happens.

---

## 2. Problem

**Wedding gifts are forgettable.**

The average wedding guest spends $150 on a gift. Most of these gifts—kitchen appliances, home goods, cash—are functional but emotionally hollow. They say "I showed up" without saying "I know you."

Meanwhile, couples receive dozens of similar items: multiple toasters, redundant towel sets, checks that blend into their bank account. Within a year, most guests couldn't name what they gave, and most couples couldn't name what they received.

The $63 billion wedding industry has optimized for convenience (registries, cash funds) at the expense of meaning. There's no category that captures:
- The collective presence of everyone who loves the couple
- Something functional that's used daily
- A gift that grows more meaningful over time

Small Plates fills this gap.

## 5. Competition & Substitutes

### When the Organizer Buys (Gift FOR the couple)

| Category | Examples | How We Differ |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Cash/Venmo** | Honeymoon funds | Forgettable, no lasting presence |
| **Registry Items** | Zola, Amazon | Transactional, no emotional depth |
| **Premium Photo Books** | Artifact Uprising, Mixbook | Static, ceremonial, displayed not used |
| **Personalized Gifts** | Storyworth, The Night Sky | Single-voice, symbolic, not functional |
| **DIY Solutions** | Canva, Shutterfly | Burden on already-overwhelmed organizers |

### When the Bride Buys (Gift FROM the couple to inner circle)

| Category | Examples | How We Differ |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Wedding Favors** | Generic favors, candy, candles | $2-5/person, forgettable, not personal |
| **Bridesmaid Gift Boxes** | Curated gift sets | One-way gift, no collaborative element |
| **Thank You Gifts** | Personalized items | Symbolic but not functional or lasting |
| **Custom Keepsakes** | Engraved items, jewelry | Personal but not collaborative or usable |

**Key insight:** In the "Bride as gifter" segment, there is no product that combines collaboration (guests contribute), personalization (their recipes, their words), and functionality (a book they'll actually use). The closest alternatives are either too generic (favors) or too symbolic (keepsakes).

## 6. Defensibility & Moat

### Current Position (Honest Assessment)

Today, Small Plates does not have a strong defensible moat. A competitor could replicate the product. However, we have:

| Asset | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **First-mover advantage** | Defining the "collaborative wedding recipe book" category |
| **Brand positioning** | Editorial, premium voice that would be costly to replicate |
| **Operational learning** | Converting 50+ messy recipes into a beautiful book is harder than it looks |

### Moat We Are Building Toward

**1. Network Effects**

Once a guest contributes a recipe, their profile exists in our system. When invited to another wedding, they can:
- Reuse their existing recipe
- Add a new one without re-entering personal info
- See their "contribution history"

As more weddings flow through Small Plates:
- More guests have profiles → easier to contribute → higher participation rates → better product → more referrals

**2. Brand Moat**

Goal: "Wedding recipe book" = Small Plates, the way "premium photo book" = Artifact Uprising.

Building through:
- Consistent editorial voice and visual identity
- Social proof and testimonials from early customers
- PR and gift guide placements
- Community of past couples and contributors

**3. Data & Content Moat (Future)**

Over time, we accumulate:
- Thousands of recipes linked to real people and weddings
- Insights on most popular recipes, regional preferences, etc.
- Potential for content marketing, "best recipes from 2025 weddings," etc.

### The Honest Pitch

> "Today we don't have an unassailable moat — and that's normal at this stage. Our plan is to build network effects by creating persistent user profiles across weddings, and brand equity by being first to define this category. In 24 months, we want 'recipe book wedding gift' to mean Small Plates."
