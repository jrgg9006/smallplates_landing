### 1.10 Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

#### Methodology

We use a **bottom-up approach** based on US wedding market data. All figures are conservative and defensible with cited sources.

---

#### TAM (Total Addressable Market): $1.45B

The TAM represents the total market for premium "hero gifts" for weddings — significant gifts that stand out from the rest.

**Logic:**

At each wedding, multiple people could purchase a premium/meaningful gift:

| Potential Buyer | Description | Opportunities |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Bridesmaid group | 4-8 people making a group gift | 1.0 |
| Bride's parents | Want to give something special to their daughter | 0.75 |
| Groom's parents | Gift for the new couple | 0.5 |
| Sibling/best friend | Very close, wants to stand out | 0.25 |
| **Total** | | **2.5 opportunities/wedding** |

**Calculation:**
```
1.94M weddings with events
× 2.5 "hero gift" opportunities per wedding
× $300 average premium hero gift price
= $1.45B
```

**Note:** This TAM includes all competitors in the premium gift space (photo books, luxury personalized gifts, premium experiences, etc.)

---

#### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market): $182M

The SAM represents the portion of TAM that Small Plates can serve given our product, pricing, and target demographic.

**Filters applied:**

| Filter | Criteria | Data | Source |
|--------|----------|------|--------|
| Budget segment | Weddings $11K+ (Standard, Premium, Luxury) | 67% of market | Perplexity/The Knot |
| Target demographic | Urban, college-educated, HHI $100K+ | 50% (conservative estimate) | — |
| **Result** | Target weddings | 650,000 | Calculated |

**Calculation:**
```
1.94M weddings
× 67% Standard/Premium/Luxury segments
× 50% target demographic
= 650,000 target weddings

650,000 weddings × 1 primary opportunity × $280 AOV
= $182M
```

**Note:** We assume 1 opportunity per wedding (not 2.5) because once someone gifts the book, other potential buyers wouldn't purchase the same product.

---

#### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market): 5-Year Projection

The SOM represents what Small Plates can realistically capture within the planning horizon.

**Projection:**

| Year | SAM Penetration | Orders | AOV | Revenue |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----|---------|
| Year 1 | 0.08% | 500 | $280 | $140K |
| Year 2 | 0.35% | 2,275 | $295 | $671K |
| Year 3 | 1.0% | 6,500 | $310 | $2.0M |
| Year 4 | 2.2% | 14,300 | $325 | $4.65M |
| Year 5 | 4.5% | 29,250 | $340 | $9.95M |

**AOV Growth Justification:**

| Year | AOV | Driver |
|------|-----|--------|
| Year 1 | $280 | Conservative initial mix |
| Year 2 | $295 | Better messaging pushes toward Tier 2 |
| Year 3 | $310 | "Bride as gifter" segment activated |
| Year 4 | $325 | Upsells and premium unboxing |
| Year 5 | $340 | Optimized mix + new products (anniversary editions) |

**Year 5 Validation:**
- 29,250 orders/year = ~80 orders/day = ~2,400/month
- 4.5% penetration is aggressive but achievable for an established DTC brand with 5 years of operation
- Natural viral loop (each book = 100+ impressions at wedding)
- 60%+ of bridesmaids organize group gifts [The Wedding Shop]
