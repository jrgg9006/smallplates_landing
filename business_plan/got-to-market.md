# Go-to-Market Strategy
## Small Plates & Co.

*Version 1.0 — December 2024*

---

## 1. GTM Philosophy

### The Core Principle

> **We don't sell. We attract.**

Small Plates is a premium brand. Our go-to-market is built on one idea: **Margot speaks to Margot.** We communicate as our ideal customer talking to her friends — cool, knowing, never desperate.

### Brand-First Approach

| Traditional DTC | Small Plates |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Lead with ads | Lead with brand |
| "Buy now" messaging | "This exists" messaging |
| Discount-driven | Value-driven |
| Transaction focus | Relationship focus |

**Why this works:**
- Our product sells itself — once someone sees it, they get it
- The viral loop is built-in — each book creates 100+ impressions
- Premium positioning requires restraint — pushy marketing kills premium perception

---

## 2. The Viral Loop: Our Unfair Advantage

**This is our most important growth mechanism — and it's free.**

### How It Works

```
1. Organizer buys a book
         ↓
2. 50-100 guests are invited to contribute recipes
   (Each one now knows about Small Plates)
         ↓
3. Book is presented at wedding
   (100-150 attendees see it)
         ↓
4. Bride shares on social media
   (Additional organic reach)
         ↓
5. Some guests have their own weddings coming up
         ↓
6. They remember Small Plates → New customer
```

### The Math

| Touchpoint | Impressions |
|------------|-------------|
| Guests who contribute | 50-100 |
| Wedding attendees who see book | 100-150 |
| Social media reach | 100-500+ |
| **Total per book** | **200-500+** |

**Each book sold is a marketing event.** The product is the marketing.

## 3. Phased Rollout

### Overview

| Phase | Timeline | Objective | Success Metric |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Soft Launch** | Now - Q1 2026 | Learn, refine, build proof | 10-15 books gifted, testimonials collected |
| **Kickstarter** | Q1-Q2 2026 | Validate demand publicly | 100 books sold, ~$15-20K raised |
| **Real Launch** | Q2-Q3 2026 | Sustainable acquisition | 20-50 orders/month |

---

### Phase 1: Soft Launch (Current)

**What we're doing:** Gifting books to friends' weddings.

**Why it matters:**
- Real-world product testing
- Collect testimonials, photos, learnings
- Build social proof before asking anyone to pay
- Start building social media presence

**Investment:** Minimal — product cost only

---

### Phase 2: Kickstarter

**Why Kickstarter:**
- Validates demand with real money
- Creates a PR moment
- Raises $15-20K without dilution
- Builds email list and community

**Goal:** 100 backers, ~$15-20K funded

**Key insight:** Position as "exclusive early access," not "help us launch." Premium brands don't beg.

---

### Phase 3: Real Launch

**Focus:** Prove sustainable customer acquisition.

**Channels:** Instagram, Pinterest, word-of-mouth (details in Section 4)

**Target:** 20-50 orders/month with CAC under $50

---

## 4. Channel Strategy

### Channel Prioritization

| Priority | Channel | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| **Primary** | Instagram | Where brides plan weddings; visual; brand-building |
| **Primary** | Pinterest | Search-based; high intent; evergreen content |
| **Primary** | Word of Mouth | Viral loop; highest trust; zero cost |
| **Secondary** | TikTok | Viral potential for emotional content; opportunistic |
| **Future** | Wedding Planners | Only 20-25% use planners; pursue when we have scale |

### Why These Channels

**Instagram + Pinterest:**
- Where our target customer (Margot Cole) lives
- Visual platforms suit our beautiful product
- Wedding planning content is huge on both
- Organic reach still possible with quality content

**Word of Mouth:**
- Built into the product (viral loop)
- Highest conversion rate of any channel
- Zero CAC
- Builds brand authentically

**TikTok (Opportunistic):**
- Best organic reach of any platform
- #WeddingTok is massive
- BUT: requires high volume of content
- Approach: post when we have great emotional content (reactions, unboxings)

**Wedding Planners (Later):**
- Only 20-25% of weddings use planners
- Relationship-based, hard to scale early
- Better to let them come to us when clients ask about Small Plates

## 5. Customer Acquisition Economics

### Target Metrics

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **CAC** | <$50 | Must be well below gross profit per order (~$90) |
| **Organic:Paid Ratio** | 70:30 | Brand should drive most acquisition |
| **Referral Rate** | 20%+ | Viral loop should generate meaningful % |
| **Conversion Rate** | 2-3% | Website visitors to purchase |

### Budget Reality

| Phase | Monthly Budget | Approach |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Soft Launch | $0-200 | Organic only; product cost |
| Kickstarter | ~$500 total | Video production, light promotion |
| Real Launch | $500/month | Boost best content, micro-influencer seeding |

**The honest truth:** We can't outspend competitors. We have to out-taste them. Brand quality and viral loop must do the heavy lifting.

---

## 6. Why We Believe This Will Work

### 1. The Product Markets Itself

Every book creates 200-500 brand impressions. We don't have to buy every customer — existing customers create new ones.

### 2. We're First in a New Category

"Wedding recipe book" has no owner. First mover with strong brand can define and own the category.

### 3. The Channels Fit the Brand

Instagram and Pinterest are natural homes for Margot Cole. We're not forcing the product into channels where it doesn't belong.

### 4. Premium Positioning Justifies Premium Price

We're not competing on price. We're competing on meaning, quality, and design. This supports healthy margins even with modest scale.

### 5. Low Fixed Costs Allow Patience

We don't need to scale fast to survive. We can build brand properly without burning cash on aggressive paid acquisition.

---

## 7. Key Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Content doesn't resonate | Test and iterate; study what works for similar brands |
| CAC too high | Prioritize organic; optimize viral loop |
| Kickstarter doesn't fund | Set conservative goal; strong pre-launch list |
| Competitors emerge | Build brand moat fast; own the category |

---

## 8. Summary

### The Strategy in One Page

**Philosophy:** Brand-first. Attract, don't chase. "Margot speaks to Margot."

**Unfair Advantage:** Each book creates 200-500 impressions. The product is the marketing.

**Phases:**
1. Soft Launch (Now-Q1 2026): Gift books, collect proof
2. Kickstarter (Q1-Q2 2026): Validate with 100 paying customers
3. Real Launch (Q2-Q3 2026): Sustainable acquisition at 20-50 orders/month

**Channels:** Instagram + Pinterest + Word of Mouth (primary); TikTok opportunistic; Planners later

**Economics:** CAC <$50, 70% organic acquisition, 20% from referrals

**Why it works:** Product markets itself, first in category, channels fit brand, low fixed costs allow patience.
