# Target Customer
## Small Plates & Co.

*Version 1.0 — December 2024*

---

## 1. Customer System Overview

Small Plates operates within an **emotional system**, not a simple buyer-seller relationship. Multiple characters interact around each purchase, each with different roles, motivations, and influence levels.

### The System

```
BUYERS                    INFLUENCERS               RECIPIENTS
─────────────────────     ─────────────────────     ─────────────────────
The Organizer             The Mother                The Couple (Bride)
(Primary)                 The Planner               
                          The Groom                 
The Bride as Gifter                                 The Bridesmaids
(Secondary)                                         (when Bride gifts)
                          
                          CONTRIBUTORS
                          ─────────────────────
                          The Guests
                          (Recipe submitters)
```

### Key Distinction: Who Buys vs. Who Receives

| Role | Buys? | Receives? | Influences? |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| The Organizer (Bridesmaid) | ✓ Primary | — | — |
| The Bride (as creator) | Sometimes | ✓ | ✓ Strong |
| The Bride (as gifter) | ✓ Secondary | — | — |
| The Mother | Sometimes | — | ✓ Strong |
| The Planner | Rarely | — | ✓ Medium |
| The Groom | Rarely | ✓ | ✓ Weak |
| The Guests | — | — | — |

**Critical insight:** The Bride is the emotional center of the system, but she is rarely the primary buyer. She is the *reason* for the purchase, not the purchaser.

---

## 2. Primary Buyer: The Organizer

The Organizer is the engine of Small Plates. She finds us, buys us, manages the collection process, and delivers the final gift.

### 2.1 Who She Is

**Typical profile:** Bridesmaid, Maid of Honor, Sister of the Bride, or close friend who has taken on gift coordination responsibilities.

| Attribute | Data | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Gender | 63% of wedding gift buyers are women | Media Culture |
| Age | Gen X and Millennials dominate (31% each) | Media Culture |
| Relationship to couple | Bridesmaid/wedding party = 15-20% of all gifts | Emmaline Bride |
| Household income | 56% earn $50K+; 18% earn $100-150K | Media Culture |
| Marital status | 56% are married homeowners | Media Culture |

### 2.2 Wedding Party Context

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average bridesmaids per wedding | 4 | The Knot |
| Typical range | 3-5 | Modern MOH |
| Small weddings (<100 guests) | 1-3 bridesmaids | Eivans |
| Large formal weddings | Up to 8-12 | Vogue |

**Implication:** With 4 bridesmaids average, there are 4 potential organizers per wedding. Typically, one (the Maid of Honor) takes the lead on group gift coordination.

### 2.3 Her Motivations

**What she carries:**
- Responsibility for giving "the best" gift
- Pressure to coordinate with other bridesmaids
- Comparison anxiety (will her gift stand out?)
- Love for the bride mixed with wedding fatigue
- Fear of getting it wrong

**Her secret question:**
> "Will she remember what I gave her?"

**What she wants:**
- A gift that lands emotionally
- Something that makes her look thoughtful
- Ease of execution (she has enough wedding stress)
- To be the hero without doing heroic work

### 2.4 Her Buying Behavior

| Behavior | Data | Source |
|----------|------|--------|
| Group gifting prevalence | 25-35% of wedding gifts involve groups | The Wedding Shop |
| Average group size | 4-10 people | Cheddar Up |
| % of bridesmaids who organize group gifts | 60%+ | Emmaline Bride |
| Individual contribution in groups | $50-75 each | Cheddar Up |
| Total group gift value | $300-800 | The Wedding Shop |
| Average gift spend (bridesmaids) | $75-150 | Emmaline Bride |

**How she finds gifts:**
- Pinterest for inspiration
- Instagram ads (discovery)
- Recommendations from friends who've been bridesmaids
- Google searches: "unique wedding gift ideas," "group wedding gift"

### 2.5 How Small Plates Serves Her

| Her Need | Our Solution |
|----------|--------------|
| Wants to be the hero | "This is the gift they'll talk about" |
| Needs it to be easy | "You invite. They send. We make the book." |
| Fears low participation | "We send up to 3 reminders per guest" |
| Wants emotional confidence | "Bride cries. You win." |
| Budget coordination | Tier pricing works for group splitting |

### 2.6 Segment Sizing: The Organizer

```
1.94M weddings with events
× 67% target segments (Standard/Premium/Luxury)
× 50% target demographic
= 650,000 target weddings

Each wedding has ~1 primary organizer opportunity
= 650,000 potential organizer-buyers

At $280 AOV (Tier 1 & 2 mix)
= $182M addressable market from this segment
```

---

## 3. Secondary Buyer: The Bride as Gifter

A less obvious but significant segment: the Bride purchasing Small Plates as a gift TO her inner circle (bridesmaids, parents, close family).

### 3.1 Who She Is

The same bride who receives Small Plates as a gift can also be a buyer — but in a different mode. She's gifting outward, not receiving.

| Attribute | Data | Source |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Age at marriage (women) | 28.6 years average | CDC |
| Age range by region | 28-35 depending on region | The Knot |
| Household income (couples) | $189,000 median | The Knot |

### 3.2 Her Motivations (as Gifter)

**What she wants:**
- To thank her bridesmaids meaningfully
- To give her parents something that captures the wedding
- To extend the wedding experience beyond the day
- Something that says "you're part of this"

**Her current options:**
| Current Gift Type | Spend | Limitation |
|-------------------|-------|------------|
| Bridesmaid proposal boxes | $50-150 each | Generic, forgettable, pre-wedding only |
| Thank-you jewelry | $75-100 each | Not unique, not experiential |
| Robes/getting-ready gifts | $30-75 each | Used once, then forgotten |
| Experiences | $100-200 each | Not tangible, no permanence |

### 3.3 Market Opportunity

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Bride spend per bridesmaid (gifts) | $75-100 | The Knot |
| Total spend for party of 4 | $300-800 | The Knot |
| Bridesmaid proposal box market | $100M+ | Fortune Business Insights |
| % of brides who gift inner circle | 70% | The AMM |
| Average bridesmaid costs (their side) | $1,200-1,800 | The AMM |

**Key insight:** The bride already spends $300-800 on bridesmaid gifts. Our Tier 3 "The Kitchen Table" ($449 for 1 Premium + 5 Classic books) fits perfectly into this behavior — giving each bridesmaid a personalized book with all the recipes.

### 3.4 How Small Plates Serves Her

| Her Need | Our Solution |
|----------|--------------|
| Thank bridesmaids meaningfully | Each gets their own copy of the book |
| Give parents something permanent | Premium hardcover for their kitchen |
| Extend the wedding experience | Book arrives post-wedding, extends the memory |
| Stand out from generic gifts | No one else is giving this |

### 3.5 Why This Segment Has No Direct Competition

The "Bride as Gifter" segment is underserved:

| Competitor | Limitation |
|------------|------------|
| Proposal boxes | Pre-wedding only, generic items |
| Jewelry | Not unique to the wedding |
| Robes | One-time use |
| Photo albums | Passive (view only), not functional |
| Cash/gift cards | Impersonal |

**Small Plates is unique:** Collaborative + personalized + functional + permanent. No competitor combines all four.

### 3.6 Segment Sizing: Bride as Gifter

```
650,000 target weddings
× 70% of brides gift inner circle
× 10% would choose Small Plates Tier 3
= 45,500 potential bride-gifter buyers

At $449 AOV (Tier 3)
= $20.4M addressable market from this segment
```

**Note:** This is incremental to the Organizer segment, not overlapping.

## 4. Key Influencers

These characters don't always buy, but they heavily influence purchase decisions.

### 4.1 The Mother

**Role:** The Guardian of permanence. She protects time.

| Attribute | Data |
|-----------|------|
| % of gifts from parents/immediate family | 20-25% |
| Average spend | $200-500+ |
| Motivation | Something that outlives the flowers |

**Her internal question:**
> "Is this serious or just trendy?"

**What she needs to hear:**
> "Hardcover. Professionally printed. Made to last decades. This isn't a trend—it's an heirloom."

**Influence pattern:** Often consulted by bridesmaids on gift ideas. Can also be a direct buyer, especially for higher tiers. May purchase Tier 2 or Tier 3 as "the family gift."

### 4.2 The Planner

**Role:** The Amplifier. She decides what matters.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| % of weddings with professional planner | 20-25% | IBISWorld |
| Full-service planners | ~15% | Grand View Research |
| Day-of coordinators | 5-10% | Grand View Research |
| DIY / self-planning | 75-80% | The Knot |

**Her filter:**
- Allergic to gimmicks
- Seeks emotional weight + aesthetic intelligence
- Values timelessness over trends

**What she needs to hear:**
> "This elevates the wedding. Intentional. Dignified. Emotional without being loud."

**Influence pattern:** Low volume but high value. When a planner recommends Small Plates, it comes with credibility. Potential B2B channel for Luxury segment weddings.

**Limitation:** Only 20-25% of weddings use planners, so this is a secondary channel, not primary.

### 4.3 The Groom

**Role:** The Witness. Not the focus, but deeply aware.

**His motivation:**
> "I want her to feel cherished."

**His concern:**
> "Is this cheesy?"

**What he needs to hear:**
> "It's a cookbook. Real recipes. Real food. You'll actually use it on a Tuesday night. Nothing cheesy about that."

**Influence pattern:** Weak direct influence, but can veto gifts that feel "too much." Small Plates' practical positioning (kitchen book, not keepsake) neutralizes his objections.

## 5. The Contributors: Guests

Guests don't buy. They give recipes. But their participation is critical to product success.

### 5.1 Who They Are

Wedding guests span all demographics:
- Grandma to college roommate
- Age 18 to 85+
- Tech-savvy to tech-averse
- Professional chefs to "I don't cook"

### 5.2 The Participation Challenge

**Barriers to contribution:**

| Barrier | Frequency | Our Solution |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| "I don't cook" | Very common | "Send your favorite takeout order. The sandwich you always get. It's not about being a chef—it's about being in the book." |
| "I don't have time" | Very common | "5 minutes. Seriously. Pick a recipe, write a note, done." |
| "My recipe isn't good enough" | Common | "Doesn't have to be fancy. Your mom's pasta. A frozen pizza hack. The point is it's yours." |
| "I forgot" | Very common | We send up to 3 automated reminders |

### 5.3 Participation Rates

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Typical book completion | 30-50+ recipes | Internal data / Industry estimates |
| Response to reminders | Improves with each reminder | Industry standard |

**What successful participation looks like:**
- Guest receives invitation email
- Opens simple submission form
- Enters recipe + personal note (5 min)
- Done — they're now "in the book"

### 5.4 The Emotional Payoff

When guests participate, they should feel:
> "Now I'm part of something."

This transforms them from spectators to contributors, from attendees to participants in the couple's story.

---

## 6. The Recipient: The Couple

The couple (primarily the Bride) is the emotional center of the entire system. Everything orbits around her reaction.

### 6.1 Demographics

| Attribute | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Average age (women) | 28.6 years | CDC |
| Average age (men) | 30.2 years | CDC |
| Median household income | $189,000 | The Knot |
| Education | Skews college-educated | Industry data |
| Location | Urban/suburban, coastal metros over-index | Industry data |

### 6.2 Her Internal World

**What she feels during wedding planning:**
- Anticipation
- Pressure
- Expectation
- Emotion
- Nostalgia
- Exhaustion
- Hope

**Her deepest fear (about gifts):**
Not "Is this pretty?" but:
> "Will this mean something when it's over?"

**What she really wants:**
- To feel seen
- To feel held
- To feel remembered
- To feel that the people around her matter as much as the day itself

### 6.3 Why She Matters for Growth

The Bride's reaction creates the **viral loop**:

```
1. Bride receives book → emotional reaction
2. Bride shows book to wedding guests → 100+ impressions
3. Bride posts on social media → organic reach
4. Guests remember for their own weddings → future customers
5. Bride recommends to engaged friends → word of mouth
```

**Each book sold creates 100+ brand impressions** at the wedding itself, plus social amplification.

### 6.4 The Moment of Truth

When she receives Small Plates, she should feel:
> "They didn't just celebrate me. They know me."

This emotional response is the engine of our entire business.

## 8. The Margot Test

Every customer-facing decision should pass through this filter:

> **"Would a 28-year-old woman in Brooklyn, champagne in hand on a rooftop, say this? Share this? Buy this?"**

**If she'd roll her eyes → rewrite.**
**If she'd say it with a knowing smile → ship it.**

This is our quality bar. Our taste filter. Our compass.
