# Email Strategy
## Small Plates & Co.

*Version 1.0 — January 2026*

---

## 1. Overview

### Why Email Matters

Email is the backbone of the Small Plates experience. It's not just communication—it's the primary mechanism that makes our flywheel spin.

**The math:**
- Each book involves 50-150 guests receiving emails
- Year 1: 500 books × 100 guests = **50,000 email recipients**
- Year 3: 6,500 books × 100 guests = **650,000 email recipients**

Every one of these people experiences our brand through email. The quality of that experience determines:
1. Whether guests contribute (book quality)
2. How they perceive Small Plates (brand impression)
3. Whether they become future customers (flywheel completion)

> **"Email is not a channel. Email IS the product experience for 99% of our touchpoints."**

## 2. Audiences

We have three distinct audiences with different needs, volumes, and strategic importance.

### 2.1 The Organizer

**Who:** Bridesmaid, Maid of Honor, sister, or friend who purchases and manages the book.

**Volume:** 1 per book

**Relationship:** Customer (paid)

**Email goals:**
- Reduce anxiety about the process
- Keep informed of progress
- Make her feel successful
- Encourage referrals

**Tone:** Supportive, clear, empowering. "You've got this."

---

### 2.2 The Guest

**Who:** Wedding guests invited to contribute recipes. Range from grandma to college roommate.

**Volume:** 50-150 per book (this is our largest audience by far)

**Relationship:** Potential future customer

**Email goals:**
- Get them to contribute (critical for product quality)
- Create positive brand impression
- Plant seed for future purchase
- Enable word-of-mouth

**Tone:** Warm but efficient. Respectful of their time. "5 minutes. That's it."

---

### 2.3 The Couple (Bride/Groom)

**Who:** Recipients of the book. Usually unaware it's being created.

**Volume:** 1-2 per book

**Relationship:** End user, potential evangelist

**Email goals:**
- Welcome to Small Plates family (post-delivery)
- Encourage social sharing
- Collect testimonials
- Long-term relationship (anniversaries)

**Tone:** Celebratory, emotional, grateful. "Welcome to the table."

## 7. Email Design Principles

### 7.1 Brand Alignment

All emails must pass the **Margot Cole test**:

> "Would a 28-year-old woman in Brooklyn, champagne in hand on a rooftop, roll her eyes at this?"

**If yes → Rewrite.**
**If she'd smile knowingly → Ship it.**

### 7.2 Copy Guidelines

**Voice:**
- Cool on the outside, emotional on the inside
- Direct, not blunt
- Warm, with edge
- Respectful of time

**Words we use:** Kitchen, table, people, real, actually, just, done, finally

**Words we avoid:** Cherish, treasure, memories, special, unique, loved ones, celebrate, journey, curated, perfect, amazing

### 7.3 Design Guidelines

**Current template strengths (keep):**
- Logo with text fallback
- Brand colors (#D4A854 gold, #2D2D2D text)
- Georgia serif for headers
- System fonts for body
- Dark mode support
- Mobile responsive
- Rounded CTA buttons

**Enhancements to consider:**
- Hero image option for engagement emails
- Space for personalization (couple photo, names)
- Preview text optimization
- More distinctive CTAs

### 7.4 Technical Requirements

- HTML email best practices (inline styles, table layout)
- Outlook/MSO conditional rendering
- Dark mode support
- Mobile responsive (600px breakpoint)
- Image fallbacks
- Plain text version
- Unsubscribe link (for marketing emails)
- Preview text meta tag

**The flywheel depends on email:**
- Guests must receive invitations → Email

**The standard is high:**
- Every email is a brand touchpoint for 50-150 people
