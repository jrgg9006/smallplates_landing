Small Plates — How It Works Page / Profile Section
Version 1.0 — Content + UX Spec

PAGE PURPOSE

This page explains, in the simplest and most beautiful way possible, what the user needs to do to create their cookbook — while reminding them why it matters.

The tone is warm, light, emotional, and extremely user-friendly.
Everything must feel: “Oh wow, this is so easy.”

This document includes:

Final polished copy

Section goals

UX reasoning

Required components (images, carousels, buttons, toggles, etc.)

Notes for designers + engineers

1. HERO SECTION
Goal

Welcome the user, set the tone, and immediately transmit simplicity, warmth, and clarity.

Copy

How it works!
Everything you need to create your cookbook — beautifully, easily, and with the people you love.

Reasoning

Short, confident, upbeat. Signals: “You’re in the right place, and this will be easy.”

Elements

Large clean hero text (centered)

Soft background illustration (plates, table scene, or abstract shapes)

Light fade-in animation

Lots of white space

2. NORTH STAR SECTION — WHY YOU’RE HERE
Goal

Anchor the user emotionally. Remind them of the bigger purpose so they stay motivated through the process.

Copy

You’re here to create a one-of-a-kind cookbook — a book that will live in your kitchen forever.
A book filled with real recipes from your favorite people: the meals they love, the drinks they make, and the stories behind them.

You’ll build this book by collecting recipes.
That’s it — and we’ll take care of the rest.

Reasoning

Emotional anchor + simplicity = clarity and motivation.

Elements

Centered text block with generous padding

Soft lifestyle photo (family table, hands cooking, etc.)

Fade-in on scroll

3. EXPECTATIONS — WHAT KIND OF RECIPES?
Goal

Remove fear (“My friends aren’t chefs”), set the right emotional vibe, increase recipe submissions.

Copy

This isn’t a professional cookbook — it’s a real cookbook.
Real breakfasts. Real dinners. Real drinks. Real stories.

Simple recipes are perfect. Messy recipes are perfect.
A photo works. A voice note works.
This is how you truly get to know your people.

Reasoning

We disarm the user and create freedom: no pressure, just joy.

Elements

Two-column layout

Left: Text

Right: Carousel of “real recipe” examples (low-fi phone photos, handwritten notes, voice memos)

Soft animation: images slide in subtly

4. THREE PATHS — HOW TO ADD RECIPES
4.1 Path 1 — Add Your Own Recipes
Goal

Encourage the user to contribute their own favorites.

Copy

You can add your own recipes — your family classics, your go-to dinners, the dishes everyone always asks you for.
Add them in seconds.

Reasoning

Short, empowering, warm.

Elements

Mini gallery of recipe cards added by the owner

Button: “Add a plate” (primary CTA)

4.2 Path 2 — Collect Recipes From Your People
Goal

Explain how easy it is to collect recipes.

4.2A — Recipe Collection Link
Copy

Send your people a simple link and let them share their recipes — no signup, no login, nothing complicated.
They can upload a recipe by text, photo, or even a quick audio message.
And the best part? They add a personal note — which becomes one of the most meaningful pieces of your book.

Share the link with one click via SMS, WhatsApp, or email.

Reasoning

Highlighting ultra-simplicity + emotional payoff.

Elements

GIF: Guest submitting a recipe (text → photo → audio)

Buttons:

“Share via SMS”

“Share via WhatsApp”

“Share via Email”

Preview of “You’ve received a recipe!” email

4.2B — Cookbook Collaboration
Copy

Want to build your cookbook together?
Invite your people to join your cookbook as collaborators.

Everyone can add their own recipes — and even collect recipes from their friends and family.
Every recipe stays in one shared place.
And best of all: everyone can print the same cookbook.

Reasoning

Explains the social magic + collaborative benefits in a friendly, energetic way.

Elements

Collaboration dashboard image

Avatar group (contributors)

Shared recipe list UI preview

Mini mockup: multiple people adding recipes

Button: “Invite collaborators”

5. THE MAGIC — WHAT WE DO FOR YOU
Goal

Show the transformation from raw recipe → beautiful designed page (this is the “wow” moment).

Copy

We turn every recipe into a beautiful, professionally designed recipe page.
You send us the real stuff — the texts, photos, audios — and we turn it into something that looks amazing.

Reasoning

This moment creates trust: “They’ll make my messy content look gorgeous.”

Elements

Before/After Carousel

Before: Raw recipe text, phone photo

After: Designed recipe page

Light morphing animation (optional)

Grid of 2–3 final recipe page styles

6. RECIPE COUNT RECOMMENDATION
Goal

Guide the user to create a high-quality book and avoid tiny, disappointing outputs.

Copy

For a beautiful hardcover cookbook, aim for 25+ recipes.
It’s easier than you think — everyone cooks at home!

With around 25–35 recipes, your cookbook becomes an ~80-page book that feels full, substantial, and meaningful.

Reasoning

This sets expectations and encourages users to keep collecting.

Elements

Thin 20-page book

Thick ~80-page book

7. THE FINAL RESULT — YOUR PRINTED COOKBOOK
Goal

Show the emotional payoff — the book as a real object that will live in their kitchen.

Copy

Here’s what you’ll receive:
A printed, hardcover, beautifully designed cookbook filled with the recipes and stories that make your life feel full.

A book made to last — something you’ll keep, share, gift, and come back to again and again.

Reasoning

This is the emotional climax. The “YES, I want this.”
