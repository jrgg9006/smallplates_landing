  Recommended Image Dimensions:

  For the recipe thumbnails (recipe_thumb_1.jpg, etc.):
  - Aspect ratio: 3:4 (width:height)
  - Recommended dimensions:
    - 600px × 800px (good for web, smaller file size)
    - 900px × 1200px (high quality)
    - 1200px × 1600px (very high quality, larger file size)

  For the full recipe spreads (recipe_spread_1.png, etc.):
  - Aspect ratio: 3:1 (for 9x6 inch book, two-page spread = 18x6 inches)
  - Recommended dimensions:
    - 1800px × 600px (good for most screens)
    - 2700px × 900px (high quality, recommended)
    - 3600px × 1200px (very high quality for large screens)
  - **Format**: Use PNG for transparency support (no white background)

  Important Notes:

  1. The thumbnails will be displayed with object-cover, so
  the entire image will fill the space
  2. Make sure the important content is centered in the image
  3. The images will be responsive and scale based on screen
  size
  4. Consider optimizing images for web (JPEG quality 80-85%
  is usually good)

  The 3:4 ratio for thumbnails makes sense as it mimics a
  portrait book page, and the 3:1 ratio for spreads
  represents an open 9x6 inch book (18x6 inches total).
