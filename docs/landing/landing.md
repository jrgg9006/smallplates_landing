# Landing Page Best Practices — Small Plates & Co.

**Goal:** Make the landing page instantly clear, emotionally resonant, and conversion-focused.

---

## 1. Above the Fold
- One clear headline that communicates the *core promise*.
- Subheadline adds emotional or functional context.
- One primary CTA ("Let's do it").
- No competing links or distractions.

## 2. Visual Hierarchy
- Strong contrast between headline and body.
- Consistent spacing (max-width ~7xl, generous padding).
- White space = luxury.
- Use only one or two font weights.

## 3. Story Flow
- Hero → Product Showcase → “Recipe Collector Tool” → CTA again.
- Each section answers: What is it? How does it feel? Why should I act?

## 4. Copy Style
- Conversational and warm, not corporate.
- Short lines, 1 idea per sentence.
- Avoid jargon or long paragraphs.

## 5. Mobile-First Design
- Design in vertical flow first (375 px width).
- Buttons full-width on mobile, side-by-side on desktop.

## 6. Accessibility
- Alt text for images.
- Keyboard focus on all buttons.
- Minimum contrast 4.5:1 for text.

## 7. Performance
- Compressed images (next/image).
- LCP < 2.5 s target.
- Avoid blocking scripts.
