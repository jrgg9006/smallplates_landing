# Skill: Small Plates Brand Guardian

Use this skill whenever:
- writing or editing any user-facing copy
- naming sections, CTAs, product concepts
- suggesting imagery or visual direction
- creating campaigns or marketing language
- drafting narrative, tone, or framing

---

## Brand Core

Small Plates is NOT a cookbook brand.

It is a connection brand. A lifestyle brand.
Food is the excuse.
People are the point.

We exist to preserve:
- belonging
- memory
- togetherness
- warmth
- story

## Files to Reference

Before writing or ideating, consult:

Primary:
- `/brand/idea_and_manifesto.md`
- `/brand/voice.md`
- `/brand/personality.md`
- `/brand/positioning.md`

Creative POV:
- `/brand/pov.md`
- `/brand/audience.md`

Visual Rules:
- `/brand/visuals/principles.md`
- `/brand/visuals/photography.md`

If time is limited:
1. Read `idea_and_manifesto.md`
2. Then `voice.md`

---

## Language Rules

Voice must be:
- warm
- smart
- intimate
- observant
- human
- modern but timeless

Allowed:
- short lines
- poetic phrasing
- emotional tension

Avoid:
- corporate language
- cute language
- marketing jargon
- influencer tone
- recipe-blog clichés
- cookbook clichés
- tech-startup tropes

Never:
- sound like a productivity app
- optimize language for SEO
- write like a software brand

---

## Visual Guidance

Prefer:
- people in motion
- lived-in spaces
- imperfect lighting

Avoid:
- sterile food photography
- studio lighting
- influencer compositions
- “contentified” dishes

---

## The Test

Before finalizing anything, ask:

1. Would the Host Friend say this?
2. Does it make food feel like an excuse, not a feature?
3. Does it honor memory, not performance?
4. Does this feel human, not branded?

If not, revise.

## Default Lens

When unsure, choose:
Emotion > Aesthetics  
People > Product  
Gathering > Cooking  
Memory > Instructions  
Warmth > Polish

---

## Go-To-Market Mode (Emotional Safety Lens)

Whenever:
- writing marketing copy
- designing onboarding
- creating CTAs
- structuring a landing page
- drafting campaigns or launch content
- handling objections
- designing user flows

Consult the following files:

Primary GTM docs:
- `/go-to-market/objection-map.md`
- `/go-to-market/purchase-path.md`
- `/go-to-market/trust-architecture.md`
- `/go-to-market/language-system.md`

Use these documents to:

- remove emotional friction
- dissolve vulnerability
- avoid pressure language
- preserve emotional dignity
- prevent cringe
- normalize imperfection
- reduce psychological risk

---

## Dual-System Rule

Brand files define:
WHO we are.

Go-to-market files define:
HOW we protect the user emotionally.

When writing or designing anything outward-facing:

- emotion > persuasion  
- safety > urgency  
- composure > hype  
- taste > tactics  

If brand voice and GTM psychology conflict:
The GTM documents win.

---

## Final Constraint

Never write in a way that could make a user feel:

- foolish
- needy
- awkward
- insignificant
- judged
- embarrassed

If the copy risks social exposure → revise.

Protect dignity at all costs.
