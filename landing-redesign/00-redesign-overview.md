## Design Principles (derived from Brand Book)

### The Margot Cole Test

Before any design decision, ask:

| Question | Required Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| Would Margot be frustrated in the first 2 minutes? | No |
| Does this look like it could be any other SaaS? | No |
| Would she put this on her screen with pride? | Yes |
| Does every word earn its place? | Yes |
| Does this feel made with care? | Yes |

### Visual Identity Application

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| **Primary Background** | Warm White #FAF7F2 |
| **Primary Accent (CTAs)** | Honey #D4A854 |
| **Primary Text** | Soft Charcoal #2D2D2D |
| **Secondary Text** | Warm Gray #9A9590 |
| **Cards/Containers** | Sand #E8E0D5 or Cream #F5F1EB |
| **Headlines** | Minion Pro (or editorial serif) |
| **Body/UI** | Inter |

### Voice Principles

- Cool on the outside, emotional on the inside
- Direct, not blunt
- No exclamation marks (almost never)
- Sound certain, not eager

## Phase Structure

| Phase | Focus | Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 1** | Current State Audit | Component inventory + friction map |
| **Phase 2** | Information Architecture | Hierarchy decisions, layout zones |
| **Phase 3** | Visual Design Direction | Color/type application, component styles |
| **Phase 4** | Layout Proposal | Wireframe with brand principles |
| **Phase 5** | Micro-copy Rewrite | All labels, buttons, empty states |
| **Phase 6** | Final Spec | Dev-ready documentation |
