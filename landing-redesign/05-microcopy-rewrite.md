# Phase 5: Micro-copy Rewrite

## Objetivo

Rewrite all interface text to align with Small Plates brand voice: cool on the outside, emotional on the inside. Direct, not blunt. No exclamation marks.

---

## Pasos

### 1. **Voice Principles Reminder**

Before writing anything, remember:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Cool on the outside** | Don't be eager. Don't oversell. |
| **Emotional on the inside** | The feeling is earned, not announced. |
| **Direct, not blunt** | Get to the point. Respect their time. |
| **Sound certain** | "This is good" > "We think you'll like this" |
| **No exclamation marks** | Almost never. Confidence doesn't shout. |

**The Margot Test:** Would a confident, stylish 28-year-old say this?

### 2. **Header Zone Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Logo | "Small Plates & Co." | "Small Plates & Co." | ✓ Keep |
| Nav item | "My Books" | "My Books" | ✓ Keep |

---

### 3. **Book Zone Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Book subtitle | (none) | "A cookbook by everyone who loves you" | Emotional core, but subtle |
| Recipe count | (none) | "12 recipes" | Simple, factual |
| Progress context | (none) | "12 of 50 recipes" or just "12 recipes" | Optional goal-setting |
| Preview CTA | (none) | "Preview Book" | No arrow. Clean. |

---

### 4. **Content Zone Header Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Label above title | "NOT A COOKBOOK" | **Remove entirely** | Confusing, negative |
| Page subtitle | "Add recipes and invite friends to build your Book" | "Recipes from the people who love you." | Use acquisition line |
| Book selector | "Ana y Ric Team SmallPlates ▾" | "[Couple Name] ▾" | Keep functional |

---

### 5. **Action Bar Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Primary CTA | (in FAB menu) "Create a new plate" | "Add a Recipe" | Clearer, more direct |
| Secondary CTA | (in FAB menu) "Invite a friend to this Book" | "Invite a Captain" | Cleaner. "Captain" is internal lingo. |

**Alternative for Primary CTA:** "Add Recipe" (even shorter)

---

### 6. **Recipe List/Grid Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Section title | "My Small Plates" | "Recipes" or "Recipes (12)" | Simpler. Count is useful. |
| Search placeholder | "Search..." | "Search recipes" | More specific |
| Plate label | "Plate" | **Remove** | Unnecessary. They know what these are. |
| Chef label | "CHEF" | **Remove** | Just show name + avatar |
| Attribution | "Added by You" | "Added by you" (lowercase) or remove | Softer |

---

### 7. **Recipe Card Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Edit action | "Edit" | "Edit" | ✓ Keep |
| Delete action | (trash icon) | "Remove" or just icon | "Remove" is gentler than delete |

---

### 8. **Recipe Detail Panel Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Panel title | "Recipe Details" | **Remove** or use recipe name | Let content speak |
| Attribution | "(Collected from link). Added on December 6, 2025. Active in Cookbook: Ana y Ric Team SmallPlates" | "Shared by [Name] · Dec 6, 2025" | Simpler, warmer |
| "Shared by" label | "Shared by Roberto Garcia" | "From Roberto García" | "From" feels more personal |
| Note field label | "Noe Optional" | "Their note" or "Note" | Fix typo. Simplify. |
| Note placeholder | "Any additional notes about this plate (optional...but encouraged!)" | "A note from [Name] about this recipe" | Remove encouragement. Let it be. |
| Uploaded files label | "Uploaded Files" | "Photos" | Simpler |
| Empty files | "See uploaded images" (repeated) | "No photos yet" | Honest, not broken-looking |

---

### 9. **Members Dropdown Copy**

| Element | Current | Proposed | Notes |
|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Header | "Cookbook Memberss" | "Captains" | Fix typo. Use correct term. |
| Role: Owner | "Owner" | "Creator" or "Lead" | More human than "Owner" |
| Role: Member | "Member" | "Captain" | Consistent terminology |
| Invite CTA | "Invite a friend to this Book" | "Add a Captain" | Shorter |
| Join date | "Joined 12/4/2025" | "Joined Dec 4" | More readable |

---

### 10. **Add Menu Copy (FAB Replacement)**

Since we're removing the FAB, these become separate CTAs:

|---------|----------|--------------|
| "Add a saved plate" | "Add from saved recipes" | Secondary option in modal |
| "Create a new plate" | "Add a Recipe" (primary CTA) | Action bar |

|---------|---------|----------|-------|
| Modal title | "Add a Small Plate" | "Add a Recipe" | Simpler |
| Guest selector label | "Guest *" | "Who made this?" | More natural |
| Guest placeholder | "Select a guest" | "Choose someone" | Warmer |
| Own plate checkbox | "This is my own plate" | "This is my own recipe" | Consistent terminology |
| Type label | "Plate type" | **Remove** | Let the tabs speak |
| Type option 1 | "Text" | "Write it" | More active |
| Type option 2 | "Images" | "Upload it" | More active |
| Name label | "Small Plate Name" | "Recipe name" | Simpler |
| Name placeholder | (empty) | "What's it called?" | Conversational |

| Ingredients label | "What you need to make this plate" | "Ingredients" | Standard, clear |
| Ingredients placeholder | "(Optional) List the ingredients needed for this plate" | "Optional — list what you need" | Shorter |
| Instructions label | "How to make this plate *" | "Instructions" | Simpler |

| Cancel button | "Cancel" | "Cancel" | ✓ Keep |

| No photo on recipe | Gray placeholder | Warm placeholder with icon, or just no image zone |
| No note on recipe | "Noe Optional" | Just don't show the field if empty, or "No note" |
