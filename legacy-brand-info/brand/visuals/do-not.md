# What We Never Do

We never:

- show food without context  
- show people without warmth  
- style intimacy  
- aestheticize loneliness  
- turn moments into content  
- document for trends  

If it feels like:
someone is watching themselves—
it's wrong.

We show people inside life.
Not performing it.
