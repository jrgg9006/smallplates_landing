# Color System

Small Plates lives in warm neutrals.

Nothing is artificial.
Nothing is modern.
Nothing is loud.

Our colors feel:

- edible
- quiet
- familiar
- domestic
- worn
- lived-in

---

## Emotional Palette

We live in:

- warm whites
- off-gray
- bread brown
- olive green
- wine red
- terracotta
- soft stone

---

## What We Never Use

❌ pure white  
❌ neon  
❌ true black  
❌ pastel trends  
❌ digital gradients  
❌ SaaS UI palettes  

If it looks like an app,
it doesn't belong.

## Color Mood Test

If the color feels like:

- sun on wood  
- wine in a glass  
- oil on linen  
- flour on hands  

It’s ours.

If it feels like:
- branding
- tech
- marketing

It’s out.
