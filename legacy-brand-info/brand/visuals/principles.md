# Visual Principles

Small Plates does not photograph food.

It photographs what food leaves behind.

A plate is never the beginning.
It is always the aftermath of someone being there.

Our imagery is proof of life.

## Our Visual Truth

Food is not the subject.
People are.

A dish is only interesting because someone touched it.

A table is only beautiful because it was shared.

We do not celebrate cooking.
We celebrate **what cooking gathers.**

## Emotional Goal

Every image must carry one of these emotions:

- belonging
- warmth
- memory
- presence
- intimacy
- ease

We are never clever.
Never loud.
Never ironic.

We are quiet confidence.

## Our World

Small Plates lives:

- after the first bite  
- during the third glass  
- when someone says “stay”  
- when chairs move closer  
- when nothing is finished  
- when nobody is in a hurry  

Our world is not styled.
It is lived.

## Visual North Star

An image is successful if it makes someone feel:

“I wish I was there.”

Not:

“That looks good.”
