# Visual Contradiction

Small Plates is built on contrast.

We pair **messy human emotion**  
with **clean editorial design**.

We treat everyday connection like an object of value.

## Our Core Tension

Emotion in front.  
Design in control.

Life is imperfect.  
Our presentation is not.

## What We Look Like

We feel:
- warm
- human
- alive
- emotional

We appear:
- calm
- minimal
- modern
- intentional

---

## What We Avoid

We never look:
- like a recipe site
- like a food blog
- like Pinterest
- like wellness branding
- like influencer kitchens
- like nostalgia cosplay

---

## What We Protect

We design like:
- a magazine
- a photo book
- an art object
- a product catalogue

We photograph like:
- a guest
- not a director
