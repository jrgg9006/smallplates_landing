# Styling

We style for reality.

Not for shoots.

## Plates

They must feel:

- used  
- mismatched  
- human  
- unprecious  

Never:
❌ matching sets  
❌ shiny ceramics  
❌ styled symmetry  

---

## Food Styling

We allow:

✅ crumbs  
✅ half portions  
✅ torn food  
✅ rough edges  
✅ imperfect plating  

We never:

❌ garnish for beauty  
❌ fake height  
❌ restaurant drama

## The Rule

If it looks:
- arranged
- decorated
- curated

It’s wrong.

If it looks:
- forgotten on a table
- passed around
- enjoyed

It’s right.
