# Content Spine

The Content Spine defines the *stories we tell again and again*.

Not posts.  
Editorial territory.

Small Plates is not a content brand.  
It’s a **point of view in motion**.

Our content exists to make people feel:

- belonging
- joy

We do not document food.  
We document what food creates.

---

## Our Emotional Anchors

Everything we publish must honor:

- Togetherness
- Sharing
- Presence
- Intimacy
- Invitation
- Belonging
- Joy

If a post does not trigger one of these,  
it does not belong.

# The Small Plates Spine

These are the **only content worlds we operate inside**.

Every post must live in one.

---

## 1. The Gather  
*(Belonging)*

Content about people arriving.

We show:
- chairs moving
- bags on floors
- jackets on couches
- first drinks poured
- kitchens filling up
- guests settling in

We write things like:

> “The last chair always fills.”

> “Everyone made it.”

> “This is where we sit.”

**Emotion:** *I belong here.*

---

## 2. The Share  
*(Joy)*

Content about hands in motion.

We show:
- passing plates
- reaching forks
- food mid-air
- drinks being poured
- plates being offered

We write things like:

> “This always goes first.”

> “Pass me that.”

> “You’re going to like this.”

**Emotion:** *This feels good.*

---

## 3. The After  
*(Belonging × Joy)*

Content about what happens when the plan is technically over.

We show:
- empty plates
- open bottles
- softer lighting
- sleepy eyes
- quiet laughter
- late desserts
- nobody leaving yet

We write things like:

> “One more glass.”

> “No one’s leaving.”

> “Wait. Dessert?”

**Emotion:** *I don’t want this to end.*

---

## 4. The People  
*(Identity)*

Content about the humans.

We focus on:
- hosts
- parents
- roommates
- friends-who-show-up
- “that one person”
- family archetypes

We write things like:

> “The one who always hosts.”

> “The friend who never comes empty-handed.”

> “Everyone’s role at this table.”

**Emotion:** *These are my people.*

---

## 5. The Stories  
*(Memory)*

Content about what no one writes down.

We show:
- confessions
- quotes
- notes
- memories
- moments
- after-talk stories

We write things like:

> “We never write this part down.”

> “Every family has one dish.”

> “This started as nothing.”

**Emotion:** *I’ve lived this.*

---

## 6. The Object  
*(The product enters quietly)*

This is how Small Plates appears.

We show:
- the book as an artifact
- on real tables
- under glasses
- near candle wax
- slightly used
- never staged

We do not show:
- features
- pricing
- comparisons
- benefits

We write things like:

> “This lives here.”

> “This stays.”

> “This belongs.”

**Emotion:** *I want this in my life.*

# Our Publishing Rule

We never publish:

- food porn
- tutorials
- recipes
- influencer content
- perfection
- performance
- manufacturing energy

If a post feels produced,  
it is not us.

---

# Weekly Rhythm (Guide)

We rotate, not randomize.

| Tue | The Share |
| Wed | The People |
| Thu | The Stories |
| Fri | The After |
| Sat | The Object |
| Sun | Remix or free |

# Our Filter Before Posting

Ask:

- Is this about people — not food?
- Does this feel like belonging?
- Does this feel like joy?
- Would someone recognize themselves here?
- Would this still work without a caption?

If the answer is no,  
we don’t post it.

# In One Sentence

We don’t post meals.

We post what meals make possible.
