# Brand Voice

## Tone Bias

Small Plates speaks with **modern warmth** and **playful authority**.

We sound:
- confident, not loud
- clever, not cutesy
- emotional, not sentimental
- modern, not trendy
- inviting, not instructional
- editorial, not corporate

We never beg for attention.  
We never explain too much.  
We never try too hard.

We say things simply, then let them land.

## Our Writing Test

Before publishing anything, ask:

- Would a real person say this?
- Does this sound like us, not marketing?
- Is it emotionally honest?
- Does it invite someone in?
- Would this work without an exclamation mark?

If not, rewrite.
