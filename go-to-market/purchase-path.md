# First Purchase Path — Small Plates

This document maps the emotional journey from first visit to checkout.

This is not “conversion.”
This is trust.

We are removing fear before we ask for action.

---

# Stage 1 — Arrival

## Emotional State:
Curious but guarded.

The user is open —
but not vulnerable yet.

They are scanning for:
- social safety
- tone
- aesthetic
- intent

---

## Goal:
Signal that this brand is emotionally intelligent.

We must communicate:

"This is not loud."
"This is not corny."
"This is not cliché."
"This is not a startup."

This is taste.

If this fails, the user leaves within seconds.

---

# Stage 2 — Recognition

## Emotional State:
"I feel this… but I don’t know why yet."

They must feel:
seen
understood
recognized

---

## Goal:
Make them feel emotionally understood before explaining anything.

Not:
“Here’s what we do.”

But:
“Here’s how you feel.”

---

## Required Experience:

- Copy that names emotional truth.
- Photography that feels human.
- No product yet.
- No how-it-works yet.
- No selling yet.

We earn permission before we describe.

---

# Stage 3 — Trust Formation

## Emotional State:
"This feels real."

Now the user wants to know:

“Is this legitimate?”
“Is this thoughtful?”
“Is this a gimmick?”

---

## Goal:
Build safety through restraint.

We prove:
- coherence
- consistency
- intention
- depth

---

## Required Experience:

- Manifesto tone
- Personality consistency
- Designed calmness
- Nothing urgent
- Nothing manipulative

No countdowns.
No urgency.
No pressure.

Only composure.

---

# Stage 4 — Emotional Desire

## Emotional State:
"I want that."

Now the user visualizes:

- the finished book
- names inside
- hands holding it
- moments in it
- sharing it
- receiving it

---

## Goal:
Show outcome before process.

Desire must precede effort.

---

## Required Experience:

- images of completed books
- interior spreads
- names and notes from people
- warmth
- imperfections
- human detail

We sell the *artifact* before the system.

---

# Stage 5 — Psychological Safety Check

## Emotional State:
"But… what if this is awkward?"

The user now confronts fear.

---

## Goal:
Dissolve emotional risk.

We must explicitly disarm:

- fear of silence
- fear of judgment
- fear of exposure
- fear of effort
- fear of looking foolish

---

## Required Messaging:

We must normalize:

- partial involvement
- no replies
- low response
- hesitation
- imperfection

We must say:

- “Not everyone replies.”
- “That doesn’t mean anything about you.”
- “This isn’t a performance.”
- “There’s no right way to do this.”
- “You can stop anytime.”

Trust is not built with guarantees.

It is built with honesty.

---

# Stage 6 — Micro-Commitment

## Emotional State:
"I might try this."

---

## Goal:
Make first action feel safe and reversible.

We must ensure:

No irreversible choices yet.

---

## Required Design:

- Preview before invite
- Create before share
- Private setup before public
- Exploration without commitment

If they feel locked in → they leave.

---

# Stage 7 — Entry

## Emotional State:
"Okay, I’m in… but gently."

---

## Goal:
Make the first action soft.

Not:
"Invite your friends."

But:
"Open a table."

Not:
"Send requests."

But:
"Pass a plate."

Not:
"Build a cookbook."

But:
"Start something."

Language must feel:

- optional
- welcoming
- low-pressure
- human

---

# Stage 8 — Checkout

## Emotional State:
"This feels right."

---

## Goal:
Make purchase feel like completion, not obligation.

---

## Required Experience:

The checkout moment must NOT feel like:

- transaction
- commitment
- permanence

It must feel like:

- affirmation
- quiet yes
- intentional step
- personal choice

---

# Emotional Contract at Checkout

We must silently communicate:

"You are not embarrassing yourself.
You are not trying too hard.
You are not doing something strange.

You are doing something human."

---
