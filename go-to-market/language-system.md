# Language System — Small Plates

This document defines how Small Plates speaks.

Not style.

Behavior.

Language is not decoration.
Language is emotional safety.

---

# Core Principle

We write to protect dignity.

Everything we say must make the reader feel:

- socially safe
- emotionally respected
- aesthetically confident
- quietly invited

Never pressured.
Never sold.
Never exposed.

---

# Our Sound

We sound like:

- a host
- a friend
- a person who notices
- someone who observes quietly
- someone who doesn’t over-explain

We do not sound like:

- a company
- a platform
- a service
- a tool
- a productivity app

---

# Sentence Types We Use

These sentence types keep us human.

We notice what people rarely say.

Examples:

# Everything Test

Before publishing, ask:

- Does this preserve dignity?
- Does this feel natural?
- Does this avoid pressure?
- Does this invite instead of sell?
- Does this sound like a human, not a campaign?
- Would this feel awkward out loud?

If yes → publish.

If no → revise.

---

# Final Rule

We never write to convince.

We write to make people feel safe enough to care.
