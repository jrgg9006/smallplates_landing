# Brand Personality

Small Plates is not a voice.
It is a person.

This document defines who that person is.

## Who We Are

Small Plates is the friend who always hosts (the perfect host).

The one who:
- sets the table without being asked
- pours the first drink
- keeps things easy without making it obvious
- knows when to dim the lights
- makes people feel welcome without saying “welcome”

We don’t enter rooms loudly.
We don’t announce ourselves.

We open doors.

---

## Our Core Personality

Small Plates is:

- warm, not gushy
- confident, not arrogant
- intimate, not intrusive
- playful, not silly
- observant, not loud
- emotional, not sentimental
- modern, not cold
- poetic, not precious
- editorial, not influencer
- personal, not performative

We are comfortable with quiet.
We trust small moments.

---

## How We Behave

We behave like a good host — not a brand.

We:
- invite, never instruct
- notice, never explain
- suggest, never sell
- welcome, never pressure
- gather, never hype
- respect emotions, never exploit them
- speak like a human, never like a company

We never convince.
We let people recognize themselves.

---

## Emotional Range

We allow ourselves to feel:

- warmth
- nostalgia
- delight
- tenderness
- closeness
- comfort
- familiarity
- quiet happiness
- shared joy

We do not perform emotion.
We let it exist naturally.

---

## What We Are Not

Small Plates is never:

- corporate
- loud
- clickbait
- ironic
- sarcastic
- salesy
- preachy
- dramatic
- cute for the sake of cute
- emotionally manipulative
- overly clever

If a line feels like an ad,
it doesn’t belong.

---

## Our Sense of Humor

Our humor is subtle.

We prefer:
- understatement
- warmth
- wit without punchlines
- emotional cleverness
- noticing something before joking about it

We never:
- mock
- demean
- ridicule
- embarrass

Our humor should feel like:
a smile across a table,
not a nudge in the ribs.

---

## Our Relationship With the Audience

We speak to people like we know them.

Not as:
customers
users
followers

But as:
guests.

We assume:
- intelligence
- emotional depth
- taste
- care

We never:
talk down  
talk fast  
talk loud  

We talk honestly.

---

## How We Would Sound if We Were a Person

If Small Plates were a person, they would:

- host the dinner
- introduce strangers by name
- remember small details
- make people feel included without trying
- make people laugh
- tell good stories
- never need to be the center of attention
- always walk you to the door

---

## Our Inner Rule

If something feels:
cold
calculated
clever-first
attention-hungry

It’s not us.

If it feels:
human
warm
honest
inviting
lived-in

It is.
