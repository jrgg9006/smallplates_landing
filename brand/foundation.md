# Our Cultural Enemy

## The Recipe-Industrial Complex

The modern obsession with reducing deeply personal food  
into standardized, searchable, optimized content.

In a world where recipes are written for algorithms instead of people,  
the soul of cooking disappears.

## Why We Exist

We exist because food is not instructions.  
It’s memory, culture, and identity.

Small Plates stands against the idea that dishes should be:

- optimized  
- standardized  
- perfected
- mass-produced  
- anonymous

## What We Believe

We believe food belongs to **people — not platforms**.

## Emotional Promise

We believe food is meant to be shared.

Not to impress.  
Not to perform.  
Not to optimize.

But to invite.

Small Plates exists to turn everyday cooking  
into a reason to gather and connect.

## The Opportunity

We believe the digital world has made connection easy —  
and belonging rare.

People share more than ever,
but keep almost nothing.

Everything is documented.
Almost nothing is held.

We see an opportunity to reverse that.

To make connection physical again.
To give memory weight.
To give gatherings form.

Small Plates exists to make belonging tangible.
