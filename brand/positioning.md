# Positioning Statement

For people who value connection and gathering,
Small Plates is the personal publishing platform
that turns shared food into a physical memory,
so they can turn everyday moments into something lasting.
Unlike photo books or recipe sites,
our product preserves connection, not just content.

## Is Small Plates a gift product or a self-purchase product?

Both — by design.

Self-purchase is the entry point.
Gift becomes the growth engine.

People buy it because they want it.
They gift it because it works.

---

## Is the first win emotional or aesthetic?

Emotional.

Design earns attention.
Emotion earns conversion and loyalty.

We sell meaning first.
Beauty supports the sale.

---

## Are we premium or accessible luxury?

Accessible luxury.

We are not:
- novelty-priced
- mass-market  
- elite-only

We are:
- meaningful
- well-made
- emotionally valuable
- culturally fluent

Price signals significance, not status.

---

## Do we sell to people or through people?

Through people.

The Host Friend is both:
- our buyer
- our distribution channel

Each book spreads the idea.
Each buyer brings others in.

---

## Are we replacing cookbooks or photo books?

Photo books.

Cookbooks are functional.
Photo books are emotional containers.

Small Plates competes with:
- memory objects
- heirlooms
- emotional gifts

Not instructional media.

---

## Is the real competition Amazon or nostalgia?

Nostalgia.

Amazon sells books.
We sell meaning.

The real alternative is forgetting.

---

## Where does trust come from — design or emotion?

Emotion first.
Design enables trust.
Emotion creates it.

People don’t trust what looks good.
They trust what feels true.

---

## What moment makes someone finally buy?

One of four emotional triggers:

1. A gathering is coming
2. A life change is happening
3. Fear of losing people
4. Desire to make something real

Purchase is emotional pressure, not logic.

## Strategic Positioning Summary

Small Plates is:

- not a cookbook
- not decor
- not content

It is:

A physical anchor for digital relationships.
A belonging machine disguised as a book.
A ritual disguised as a product.
A connection platform with no screen.
