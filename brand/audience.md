# Audience Archetypes

Small Plates is not built for demographics.

It is built for identities.

We design for how people live, gather, and care —  
not how old they are.

## Primary Archetype: The Host Friend

This is our core.

The Host Friend is the person who brings people together.

They may not be the best cook in the room,
but they are always the one who:

- opens their door
- pours the first drink
- sets the mood
- keeps the group alive
- creates traditions without announcing them

They are the emotional infrastructure of their circle.

### Profile

- Age range: ~26–40
- Lives in a city or culturally active neighborhood
- Loves hosting (dinners, brunch, wine nights, game nights)
- Cares about atmosphere as much as food
- Keeps a core group of people close
- Emotionally generous by nature

### What They Care About

- Belonging
- Shared experiences
- Making people feel welcome
- Creating moments that don’t feel forced
- Rituals (weekly dinners, birthday traditions, Sunday meals)

### What They Fear

- People drifting apart
- Becoming “too busy” to gather
- Hosting that feels like pressure
- Losing friendships to time and distance
- Being perceived as try-hard

### Their Relationship With Food

Food is their tool for togetherness.

They cook:
- to invite  
- to keep people close  
- to make nights feel special  

Not to perform.
Not to impress.
Not to optimize.

They have “their” dishes that:
- friends always expect  
- never get old  
- are more emotional than precise  

### Why They Buy Small Plates

Small Plates gives the Host Friend:

- A way to turn relationships into something tangible
- A new ritual to share with their circle
- A reason to gather people again
- Recognition for what they already do
- A physical artifact of their social life

### Likely Buying Moments

- Upcoming birthday (theirs or a friend’s)
- New apartment or house
- Engagement / wedding
- Big life transitions
- Holidays
- “We should do something special for our group” moments

### What Hooks Them

They respond to lines like:

> “Not a cookbook. A book made out of your people.”  
> “For the plates that bring everyone over.”  
> “You didn’t make this to post it. You made it to share it.”

## Secondary Archetype: The Memory Keeper

The Memory Keeper fears losing people more than losing things.

They are the ones who:
- save photos
- remember dates
- archive stories
- keep emotional artifacts
- document life quietly

Food, for them, is memory and origin.

### What They Care About

- Family history
- Nostalgia
- Permanence
- Legacy

### Their Fear

Regret.

Not asking.
Not recording.
Not saving.

### Why They Buy Small Plates

To preserve:
- family dishes
- emotional stories
- personal histories

They see Small Plates as an heirloom —
not a product.

### What Hooks Them

> “We don’t collect recipes. We collect who made them.”  
> “For the plates you’d regret losing.”

## Tertiary Archetype: The Style Home Curator

This person curates life through objects.

They are visually driven, aesthetically conscious,
and emotionally selective.

They buy with taste — not necessity.

### What They Care About

- Design
- Atmosphere
- Identity through objects
- Owning meaningful things
- Being culturally early to brands

### Why They Buy Small Plates

Because it looks beautiful *and* means something.

It becomes:
- a conversation object
- a shelf centerpiece
- part of their home identity

### What Hooks Them

> “Not decor. Proof.”  
> “For people whose home has a story.”
