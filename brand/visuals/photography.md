# Photography Direction

Small Plates photography has two modes:

1. Dishes as Objects
2. People as Proof

Both are required.
Neither stands alone.

---

## MODE 1 — Dishes as Objects

Your recipe images are simple, quiet, minimal.

They feel:

- editorial
- neutral
- calm
- isolated
- unforced

### They should feel:

Like artifacts.
Not advertisements.

A plate alone does not exist to impress.
It exists to be remembered.

### Composition rules:

✅ centered or slightly off  
✅ negative space  
✅ soft overhead light  
✅ no clutter  
✅ minimal backgrounds  

### We never:

❌ style theatrically  
❌ use decorative garnish  
❌ show steam for drama  
❌ oversaturate  
❌ “hero” lighting  

Food is not performing.
It is resting.

## MODE 2 — People as Proof

This is the heart of the brand.

People are not posing.
They are not aware of the camera.

They are inside the moment.

### We accept:

✅ blurry hands  
✅ half faces  
✅ moving bodies  
✅ laughing mouths  
✅ reaching arms  
✅ refilling glasses  
✅ wine spilled  
✅ light missing  
✅ imperfect framing  

### We never:

❌ choreograph  
❌ stage  
❌ fake laughs  
❌ overexpose  
❌ make people model  
❌ smile into the lens  

The moment never knows it's being documented.

## Lighting

Emotional > technical

We allow:

✅ shadows  
✅ warm bulbs  
✅ golden-hour light  
✅ dusk darkness  
✅ window spill  

We reject:

❌ flash  
❌ flat studio light  
❌ ring-light energy

## Camera Feel

Photography should feel:

- found
- real
- imperfect
- intimate
- human

Not produced.
Not polished.
Not PR.
