# Creative POV

Small Plates does not exist around food.

It exists around people.

Food is not the main event.  
It’s the excuse.

The invite.  
The spark.  
The thing that brings everyone into the same room.

Before the meal.  
During the meal.  
After everything’s gone.

This is where we live.

## How We See Food

Food is not the hero.

It’s the bridge.

It connects strangers.  
Brings families together.  
Turns nights into memories.

## The Small Plates Lens

We don’t see food the way others do.

We see it like this:

### A Chair
**Generic:** A chair in a kitchen.  
**Small Plates:** The chair everyone fights to sit in.

### A Dish
**Generic:** A meal.  
**Small Plates:** The first thing that’s always gone.

### Wine
**Generic:** Beverage.  
**Small Plates:** The excuse everyone needed to stay longer.

### A Recipe
**Generic:** Instructions.  
**Small Plates:** A story nobody ever wrote down.

### A Kitchen
**Generic:** A cooking space.  
**Small Plates:** The place where plans changed.

## What We Notice (That Others Ignore)

We romanticize:

- busy kitchens  
- open bottles  
- people showing up early “to help”  
- conversations starting mid-cooking  
- second servings  
- spilled drinks  
- hosts who don’t stop moving  
- someone quietly doing the dishes  
- couches full of people  
- group chats still buzzing the next morning

## What We Never Center

We do not center:

- perfection  
- performance  
- technique  
- authority  
- rules  
- optimization  

If it feels staged,  
we’re not interested.
