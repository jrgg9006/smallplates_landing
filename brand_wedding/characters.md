# Characters — The Wedding Cast

Small Plates is not a product.
It’s a story with people inside.

These are not “personas”.
They are roles in an emotional system.

Every decision we make should work for at least one of them.
Great decisions work for more than one at once.

---

## The Bride — The Center

She is not the buyer most of the time.
She is the reason.

She lives inside:
- anticipation
- pressure
- expectation
- emotion
- nostalgia
- exhaustion
- hope

Her fear is not:
“Is this pretty?”
It’s:
“Will this mean something when it’s over?”

What she really wants:
- to feel seen
- to feel held
- to feel remembered
- to feel that the people around her matter as much as the day itself

Small Plates gives her:
not another detail,
but a piece of her people.

When she receives it, she should feel:
“They didn’t just celebrate me.
They know me.”

---

## The Bridesmaid — The Protector

She is the engine.

She carries:
- responsibility
- comparison
- pressure
- love
- fear of getting it wrong

Her secret question:
“Will she remember what I gave her?”

She doesn’t want:
a gift that blends in.

She wants:
a moment that lands.

Small Plates gives her:
- emotional confidence  
- creative relief  
- proof that she chose right  

When she gives it, she should feel:
“I gave her something only *I* would think of.”

---

## The Mother — The Guardian

She protects time.

She feels:
the wedding is not the point —
the life after it is.

She wants:
something that outlives the flowers.

Small Plates tells her:
“Her home will be filled with love.”

When she gives it, she should feel:
“This is not just for her wedding.
This is for her life.”

---

## The Planner — The Amplifier

She doesn’t buy.
She decides what matters.

She is allergic to:
- gimmicks
- cheap emotion
- obvious trends

She looks for:
- emotional weight
- aesthetic intelligence
- timelessness

Small Plates earns her when it feels:
- intentional
- dignified
- emotional without being loud

When she recommends it, it should feel:
“This elevates the wedding.”

---

## The Guests — The Contributors

They don’t buy.

They give:
a recipe
a memory
a part of themselves.

For them, Small Plates is:
a way to be present
before the wedding happens.

When they participate, they should feel:
“Now I’m part of something.”

---

## The Groom — The Witness

Not the focus.
But deeply aware.

He wants:
her to feel cherished.

When Small Plates enters the picture, it should feel:
“This is something she’ll keep.”

---

## The System View

Bride = emotional center  
Bridesmaid = momentum  
Mother = permanence  
Planner = credibility  
Guests = meaning  
Groom = witness  

Small Plates only works if:
everyone feels acknowledged —
but one person feels chosen.

That person is the bride.
