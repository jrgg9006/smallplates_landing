## The Dual System

Small Plates uses two complementary lines that serve different purposes:

| Line Type | Tagline | Function |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Brand Line** | "Still at the table." | Emotional, identity, resonance |
| **Acquisition Line** | "Recipes from the people who love you." | Explanatory, clarity, attraction |

## Brand Line

> **"Still at the table."**

### What it means

"Table" is not a piece of furniture.
It's one of the most powerful cultural symbols for **belonging, connection, and shared life.**

- "Having a seat at the table" — Belonging. Being included.
- "Bringing something to the table" — Contributing. Adding value.
- "The family table" — Connection. Home. Roots.

When we say "Still at the table," we're saying:
**They're still part of your life. Still in your circle. Still with you.**

Every time the couple opens the book, every time they cook a recipe, every time they read a name—those people are still there. Still at the table.
