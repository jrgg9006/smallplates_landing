# Trust Architecture

People don’t trust brands with logistics.
They trust brands with emotion.

Small Plates isn’t asking for an order.
It’s asking for:
memories,
names,
stories,
love.

Trust is not built with guarantees.
It’s built with signals.

## What Trust Must Feel Like

Trust at Small Plates is not:
- technical
- corporate
- legal
- cold
- overly perfect

It should feel:
- human
- warm
- intentional
- personal
- calm
- grounded

Like handing someone something delicate
and knowing it will be treated with care.

## The Four Pillars of Trust

### 1. Emotional Legibility

People should immediately understand:
what this is about.

Not features.
Not workflow.

Feeling.

Every page, sentence, and image should answer one question:
"Does this feel made for her?"

---

### 2. Editorial Seriousness

Small Plates should feel more like:
a beautiful book
than an app.

Nothing:
- noisy
- clicky
- hollow
- templated

Fonts, layouts, and silence matter.

If it looks:

fashion magazine > startup landing page  
coffee-table book > SaaS product  

We are on the right path.

### 3. Respect for Intimacy

We never:
- sell data
- exploit emotion
- require public sharing

Everything feels:
private
gentle
opt-in

No social pressure.
No forced participation.
No gamification.

It feels safe to ask people for something meaningful.

---

### 4. Ownership & Permanence

Trust increases when something feels:
real.

Not digital-only.
Not abstract.

Small Plates always ends in:

A physical book.
A real object.
A permanent artifact.

People trust what:
they can hold.

---

## Our Silent Contract

When someone uses Small Plates,
they are trusting us with:

- relationships
- memory
- vulnerability

Our promise is:
we will never trivialize that.

---

## What Trust Looks Like in Practice

Trust shows up as:

- generous white space  
- restrained color  
- real photography  
- slow pacing  
- simple language  
- no hype  

If it sounds like marketing,
we failed.

If it sounds like care,
we succeeded.

## The Trust Test

Every feature, asset, and message must pass one question:

"Does this handle the bride with care?"

If not:
it doesn’t ship.
