# Value Proposition — For the People Who Buy It

### (Bridesmaids, Family, Planners)

Small Plates is not just a gift.

It’s a way to make the bride feel deeply seen —
without putting more on her plate.

You’re not giving her “something nice”.
You’re giving her:
a moment,
a feeling,
a story made of people she loves.

## What You’re Really Giving

When you give Small Plates, you’re giving her:

- a sense that people showed up emotionally — not just physically  
- a wedding that starts before the wedding  
- a reason to feel surrounded, not watched  
- a reminder of who she is when everything feels like logistics  
- a piece of her people that stays after the day is over  

You’re not buying a book.

You’re building a moment that will last longer than the dress, the flowers, and the night.

## Why This Is The Right Gift

Most wedding gifts are chosen because they’re easy.

Small Plates is chosen because it *means something*.

It’s a gift that:

- doesn’t compete with the registry  
- doesn’t live in a closet  
- doesn’t fade after the honeymoon  
- doesn’t scream “I had 10 minutes to figure this out”  

It quietly says:

“I see you.”
“I know you.”
“You matter to me.”

## Why This Doesn’t Feel Like Work

Small Plates is designed so you never feel like:
- you’re organizing a project
- you’re chasing people
- you’re doing emotional labor
- you’re creating pressure

It gives you:

- a simple way to invite participation  
- an easy way to involve others  
- a beautiful way to gather love without awkwardness  
- tools that feel human, not technical  

It feels light.
It feels warm.
It feels meaningful.

Not heavy.

## Why This Feels Different From Everything Else

Wedding gifts usually do one of two things:

They decorate.
Or they disappear.

Small Plates does something else:

It holds people.

It’s the one gift that:
- includes everyone without being a group project  
- feels intimate without being invasive  
- is emotional without being overwhelming  
- honors the bride without making the day heavier  

It lets you give connection instead of clutter.

## The Quiet Truth

You’re not just giving her something.

You’re giving her:
her people —
bound in one place —
for the rest of her life.
