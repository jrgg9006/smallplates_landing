# Visual Identity Brief
## Small Plates & Co. — Version 1.0

---

# The Vision

Small Plates should look like it **feels**.

And it feels like:
- Champagne on a terrace at night
- Jazz playing low in the background
- A late dinner with people you actually like
- Something you want in your home for a long time

The visual identity must communicate:

> **Cool on the outside. Emotional on the inside.**

Sophisticated but alive.
Elegant but warm.
Editorial but human.
Premium but not pretentious.

---

# The Woman We're Designing For

Every visual decision should pass through this filter:

> **Would a 28-year-old woman with New York energy, confident and stylish, want this in her kitchen? Would she proudly show it to her friends?**

She wears:
- A long dress, minimal but intentional
- Neutral tones with one bold detail
- Natural makeup that still feels polished

She is not:
- Basic
- Cheesy
- Overly traditional
- Pinterest-predictable

She is:
- Effortlessly cool
- Genuinely warm
- Quietly confident

The visual identity should feel like **her**.

---

# Color Palette

## Philosophy

The wedding industry is drowning in:
- Blush pink
- Sage green
- Rose gold
- Safe neutrals

Small Plates needs to stand apart.

The palette is built on **warmth with sophistication**—colors that feel like golden hour, candlelight dinners, honey in the sun. Not cold. Not corporate. Not predictable.

---

## Primary Palette

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code | RGB | Usage |
|------|------------|----------|-----|-------|
| **Primary Accent** | Honey | #D4A854 | 212, 168, 84 | CTAs, buttons, highlights, moments of energy |
| **Primary Neutral** | Warm White | #FAF7F2 | 250, 247, 242 | Backgrounds, canvas, breathing room |
| **Primary Dark** | Soft Charcoal | #2D2D2D | 45, 45, 45 | Primary text, logo |

---

## Secondary Palette

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code | RGB | Usage |
|------|------------|----------|-----|-------|
| **Warm Accent** | Terracotta | #C4856C | 196, 133, 108 | Secondary accent, warmth in photography |
| **Cool Accent** | Olive | #6B7B5E | 107, 123, 94 | Organic feel, nature, secondary moments |
| **Soft Neutral** | Sand | #E8E0D5 | 232, 224, 213 | Subtle backgrounds, cards, soft contrast |

---

## Extended Neutrals

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Cream | #F5F1EB | Alternative light background |
| Warm Gray | #9A9590 | Secondary text, captions |
| Deep Charcoal | #1A1A1A | Headlines when more contrast needed |

---

## Color Usage Rules

### Do

- Use Honey sparingly—it's the spice, not the main dish
- Let Warm White breathe—generous whitespace is part of the identity
- Use Soft Charcoal for most text—it's softer than pure black
- Let photography bring additional color naturally

### Don't

- Don't use Honey for large background areas (overwhelming)
- Don't use pure black (#000000)—always Soft Charcoal or Deep Charcoal
- Don't use pure white (#FFFFFF)—always Warm White or Cream
- Don't introduce pinks, blues, or purples—they break the warmth

---

## Color Ratios by Application

| Application | Warm White | Soft Charcoal | Honey | Secondary |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Website | 70% | 20% | 8% | 2% |
| Packaging | 60% | 25% | 12% | 3% |
| Social Media | 50% | 25% | 20% | 5% |
| Book Interior | 80% | 15% | 3% | 2% |

---

# Typography

## Philosophy

The typography must balance:
- **Editorial sophistication** (we're a book company)
- **Modern clarity** (we're a tech-enabled product)
- **Human warmth** (we're about people and connection)

---

## Primary Type System

### Serif — Minion Pro

**Usage:** Headlines, titles, emotional moments, the book itself

**Why it works:**
- Classic editorial feel
- Highly readable at various sizes
- Sophisticated without being stuffy
- Works beautifully in print (important for the book)

**Weights to use:**
- Regular (body in book)
- Semibold (headlines)
- Italic (emphasis, quotes, special moments)

---

### Sans-Serif — Inter

**Usage:** Body text (digital), UI elements, functional copy, captions

**Why it works:**
- Extremely legible on screens
- Modern but not cold
- Pairs perfectly with Minion Pro
- Versatile weight range

**Weights to use:**
- Regular (body)
- Medium (emphasis)
- Semibold (buttons, labels)
- Bold (sparingly, for strong emphasis)

---

### Script — To Be Selected

**Usage:** "& Co." in logo, special moments, signature feel

**Direction:** Elegant but not overly formal. Should feel like beautiful handwriting from someone with good taste—not calligraphy, not childish.

**Characteristics to look for:**
- Fluid but readable
- Slightly irregular (human, not mechanical)
- Works at small sizes
- Feels personal, not performative

**Reference styles:**
- Modern calligraphy (not traditional)
- Fashion editorial scripts
- High-end restaurant menus

**Candidates to explore:**
- Burgues Script
- Carolyna Pro Black
- Wishes Script
- Playlist Script
- Andora Modern Script

**Note:** The script is an accent, not a workhorse. Use sparingly for maximum impact.

---

## Type Hierarchy

| Level | Font | Weight | Size (Desktop) | Size (Mobile) | Use Case |
|-------|------|--------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| H1 | Minion Pro | Semibold | 48-64px | 32-40px | Page heroes, major headlines |
| H2 | Minion Pro | Semibold | 36-42px | 28-32px | Section headers |
| H3 | Minion Pro | Regular | 24-30px | 20-24px | Subsection headers |
| Body | Inter | Regular | 16-18px | 16px | Paragraphs, descriptions |
| Small | Inter | Regular | 14px | 14px | Captions, labels |
| Button | Inter | Semibold | 14-16px | 14px | CTAs, buttons |
| Accent | Script | — | Variable | Variable | "& Co.", special moments |

---

## Typography Rules

### Do

- Mix Minion Pro and Inter intentionally—serif for emotion, sans for function
- Use generous line height (1.5-1.7 for body text)
- Let headlines breathe with ample spacing
- Use italic Minion Pro for quotes and emphasis

### Don't

- Don't use all caps for long text (okay for short labels)
- Don't use script for body text—ever
- Don't mix more than these three typefaces
- Don't use thin/light weights—they feel weak

---

# Logo Direction

## Current State

```
Small
plates
& Co.
```

**What works:**
- Clean, minimal
- Good type contrast (Minion Pro + Inter bold)

**What needs work:**
- "& Co." feels like an afterthought
- The double meaning isn't visible
- Lacks warmth and personality
- Doesn't differentiate from generic brands

---

## The Strategic Opportunity

"& Co." is not just a name suffix—it's the **heart of the concept**.

Small Plates = the food, the recipes, the book
& Company = the people, the presence, the connection

The logo should make this duality **visible**.

---

## Direction 1: Script "& Co."

```
Small Plates
      & Co.
```

- "Small Plates" in Minion Pro (as current)
- "& Co." in elegant script
- Script adds warmth, humanity, personal touch
- Connects to wedding aesthetic without being obvious
- The ampersand becomes a visual signature

**Variations to explore:**
- Script slightly overlapping the serif text
- Script in Honey color
- Script underlined with a subtle stroke

---

## Direction 2: Emphasized Ampersand

```
Small Plates
    & Co.
```

- The "&" becomes a design element
- Larger, bolder, possibly in Honey
- Could be a standalone icon/mark
- "Co." in Inter or script

**The "&" as brand mark:**
- Use alone as favicon, social avatar, app icon
- The symbol of connection
- Simple, ownable, memorable

---

## Direction 3: Stacked with Intention

```
SMALL PLATES
& Company
```

- "SMALL PLATES" in spaced caps (Minion Pro)
- "& Company" in script, written out fully
- More formal, more editorial
- "Company" spelled out emphasizes the double meaning

---

## Direction 4: Integrated Script

```
Small Plates & Co.
```

- All on one line
- "Small Plates" in Minion Pro
- "&" as transitional element (could be decorative)
- "Co." in script, connecting fluidly

---

## Logo Color Applications

| Version | Background | "Small Plates" | "&" | "Co." |
|---------|------------|----------------|-----|-------|
| Primary | Warm White | Soft Charcoal | Honey | Soft Charcoal or Script |
| Inverted | Soft Charcoal | Warm White | Honey | Warm White |
| Mono Light | Warm White | Soft Charcoal | Soft Charcoal | Soft Charcoal |
| Mono Dark | Soft Charcoal | Warm White | Warm White | Warm White |

---

## Logo Clear Space

Minimum clear space around logo = height of "S" in "Small"

No other elements should enter this space.

---

## Logo Minimum Sizes

| Application | Minimum Width |
|-------------|---------------|
| Digital | 120px |
| Print | 1 inch / 25mm |

---

## Logo Don'ts

- Don't stretch or distort
- Don't change the typefaces
- Don't rearrange elements
- Don't add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines)
- Don't place on busy backgrounds without container
- Don't use colors outside the palette

---

# Photography Style

## Philosophy

Small Plates photography should feel like **a really talented friend is documenting real moments**—not a commercial photographer staging scenes.

The goal is:
- Authentic over perfect
- Warm over cool
- Dynamic over static
- Human over product

---

## The Feeling

Every photo should feel like:
- A stolen moment at a great dinner party
- The warmth of golden hour
- Friends who actually like each other
- Real joy, not performed joy

---

## Technical Direction

### Lighting

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Natural light, especially golden hour | Harsh flash or studio lighting |
| Soft, directional light | Flat, even lighting |
| Warm color temperature | Cool or blue tones |
| Dappled light, shadows that add depth | Overexposed, blown-out highlights |
| Candlelight, string lights for evening | Clinical, corporate lighting |

---

### Composition

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Movement, action, mid-moment | Static, posed, frozen |
| Slightly imperfect framing | Over-composed, too perfect |
| Depth of field (subject focus, soft background) | Everything in sharp focus |
| Interesting angles (overhead, close-up details) | Straight-on, predictable |
| Negative space that breathes | Cluttered, busy frames |

---

### Subject Matter

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| People interacting with food | Food alone, isolated |
| Hands cooking, serving, sharing | Untouched, pristine plates |
| Real expressions, laughter, connection | Posed smiles, looking at camera |
| Groups of friends, families, couples | Solo individuals (usually) |
| Lived-in kitchens, real tables | Staged, sterile environments |
| The book being USED (stained, open, in action) | The book as a pristine object |

---

### Color in Photography

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Warm tones that match the palette | Cool, desaturated, moody |
| Natural colors of food and skin | Over-filtered or heavily edited |
| Honey/golden accents when possible | Neon, artificial colors |
| Earth tones, naturals, creams | Bright pinks, blues, purples |

---

## Photography Categories

### 1. Lifestyle / People

**Primary category.** This is what differentiates Small Plates.

- Friends around a table
- Couples cooking together
- Families sharing meals
- Hands passing dishes
- Candid laughter, real moments
- Wedding-adjacent without being "wedding photography"

**Energy level:** High. Dynamic. Alive.

---

### 2. Food

**Secondary.** Always in context, never isolated.

- Dishes being prepared or served
- Tables full of shared plates
- Ingredients in motion
- Imperfect, delicious, real food
- Never overly styled "food porn"

**Energy level:** Medium. Inviting. Approachable.

---

### 3. Product (The Book)

**Tertiary.** The book is the outcome, not the hero.

- The book in a real kitchen
- The book being cooked from (open, used)
- Hands turning pages
- Close-ups of handwritten notes, names
- Slightly worn, loved, lived-in

**Energy level:** Lower. Intimate. Emotional.

---

## Photography Don'ts — Absolute Rules

| Never | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Stock photography feeling | Kills authenticity |
| People looking at camera smiling | Feels staged, ad-like |
| Isolated product shots on white | Cold, e-commerce, not us |
| Perfectly styled food | Not real, not approachable |
| Cool/blue color grading | Contradicts brand warmth |
| Empty tables, empty kitchens | We're about people, not spaces |
| Overly "wedding" imagery (veils, rings, cakes) | We're adjacent to weddings, not a wedding brand |
| Sad, serious, somber moods | We're about joy and connection |

---
