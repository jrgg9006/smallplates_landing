# How We Sound

---

## The Voice

Small Plates sounds like the friend who always knows.

Knows the restaurant you should try.
Knows the song you'll love before you hear it.
Knows when to push and when to let it be.

She doesn't explain herself.
She doesn't over-sell.
She just says it—and you trust her.

Because she's always right about these things.

Not loud. Not quiet.
Just... certain.

The kind of voice that makes you lean in,
not because she's whispering,
but because what she's saying is worth hearing.

---

## The Formula

This is the rule that governs everything:

> **Cool on the outside. Emotional on the inside.**

Not the reverse. Never the reverse.

The surface is confident, stylish, effortless.
The core is deeply human, genuinely caring, emotionally real.

Think of it like the book itself:
- **The cover:** Minimal. Designed. Something you want on display.
- **The pages:** Handwritten notes. Family recipes. Names that make you cry.

The voice works the same way.

We don't lead with emotion. We earn it.
We don't beg for attention. We deserve it.
We don't explain why this matters. We show it.

---

## The Four Principles

Every piece of Small Plates communication should feel like these four things—in different proportions depending on context and audience.

---

### 1. Warm, With Edge

We care. Genuinely.
But we're not soft about it.

Warmth doesn't mean gentle.
It means present. Real. Human.

We're the friend who shows up with food when you're sad—
and also tells you when you're being ridiculous.

**Warm with edge** = Love that doesn't coddle.

We sound like:
- Someone who actually knows you
- A friend, not a brand
- Honest, even when it's easier not to be

We don't sound like:
- A greeting card
- Customer service
- Someone trying too hard to be liked

---

### 2. Direct, Not Blunt

We say what we mean.
First sentence. No warmup.

But direct doesn't mean harsh.
It means we respect your time.
We get to the point because the point is worth getting to.

**Direct, not blunt** = Clarity with care.

We sound like:
- Someone confident in what they're saying
- Efficient without being cold
- Clear, even about emotional things

We don't sound like:
- A press release
- A legal disclaimer
- Someone who uses ten words when three would do

---

### 3. Effortless, Not Lazy

We make it look easy.
That's the skill.

The writing flows. The rhythm feels natural.
But underneath, every word is chosen.

**Effortless, not lazy** = The craft is invisible.

We sound like:
- Someone who's naturally good with words
- Cool without trying
- Smart without showing off

We don't sound like:
- Overly casual or sloppy
- Trying to be "relatable"
- Like we didn't care enough to edit

---

### 4. Moving, Not Pushing

We create momentum.
We make people want to act.

But we never pressure. Never guilt. Never create fake urgency.

The energy comes from excitement, not anxiety.
"You're going to want to do this" — not "You need to do this now."

**Moving, not pushing** = Invitation with energy.

We sound like:
- Someone sharing something good
- Excited, not desperate
- Confident the product speaks for itself

We don't sound like:
- A salesperson
- An alarm clock
- Someone who needs you to say yes

---

## The Rhythm

Small Plates has a distinctive beat.
Fast enough to feel alive. Slow enough to feel intentional.

### Short punches.
### Then a longer thought that lets the idea land and gives it room to breathe.
### Then short again.

We don't drag.
We don't rush.
We move.

---

### The Line Break Rule — Updated

Line breaks are emphasis, not decoration.

Use them to create rhythm.
Use them to let a thought land.
Don't use them to make everything feel "poetic."

**Good:**
> A recipe from your best friend.
> A note from your grandmother.
> A reason to cook together.

**Bad:**
> A recipe.
> From your best friend.
> A note.
> From your grandmother.
> A reason.
> To cook.
> Together.

The first has rhythm. The second has asthma.

Something feeling basic, predictable, or cheesy.

"This makes your guests part of the story. They're not just attending—they're contributing to something that lasts."

**How we sound to her:**
Empowering. Exciting. Like we're letting her in on a secret.

**Who she is:**
- The one actually buying and managing this

Clear. Energizing. "You've got this."

### The Guests

**Who they are:**
- Everyone from grandma to college roommate
- Busy. Distracted. Will ignore the first email.
- Some don't cook and feel like they have nothing to offer.

**What they fear:**

**What they need to hear:**
"Don't overthink it. Send something. Anything. It takes 5 minutes and you're done."

**How we sound to them:**
Light. Zero pressure. A little funny. "Just do it, it's easy."

---

### The Groom

---

>
> The kind you actually open.

**Example — Social proof:**
> 47 recipes.
> 47 people.
> One kitchen.

## The Energy Scale

Different moments need different energy. Here's the range:

| Context | Energy Level | Feels Like |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Guest reminders | High | "Come on, let's go, you've got this" |
| Organizer dashboard | Medium-High | "You're doing great, here's what's next" |
| Homepage | Medium-High | "This is good, let me show you" |
| How it works | Medium | "Here's the deal, super simple" |
| Bride-as-creator flow | Medium-High | "You're building something amazing" |
| Emotional sections | Medium-Low | "This is why it matters" |
| Packaging | Low | "Let it land" |
| Post-delivery | Low-Medium | "You did it. Enjoy this." |

The key: we can go low-energy, but we should never go passive. Even quiet moments have intention.

---

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- **Start strong.** First sentence earns the second.
- **End with momentum.** Last line should make them want to act or feel something.
- **Use "you."** We're talking to someone, not at them.
- **Be specific.** "Your mom's pasta" > "a family recipe."
- **Make it easy.** Reduce friction in language. "5 minutes. Done."
- **Sound certain.** "This is good" > "We think you'll like this."
- **Mix short and long.** Rhythm matters.
- **Read it out loud.** If it sounds like a brand, rewrite it.

### Don't

- **Don't hedge.** No "maybe," "perhaps," "we think."
- **Don't over-explain.** Trust the reader.
- **Don't use exclamation points.** Almost never. Confidence doesn't shout.
- **Don't start with "We're excited..."** We're not a press release.
- **Don't be passive.** Even emotional moments have forward motion.
- **Don't guilt or pressure.** Energy yes, anxiety no.
- **Don't use emojis.** Exception: Stories, sparingly.
- **Don't sacrifice clarity for style.** If it's cool but confusing, rewrite.

---

## The Gut Check

Before publishing anything, ask two questions:

**Question 1:**
> "Would our 28-year-old New York woman, champagne in hand on a rooftop, say this?"

If it sounds like something she'd roll her eyes at—rewrite.
If it sounds like something she'd say with a knowing smile—ship it.

**Question 2:**
> "Does this make someone want to do something?"

Not pressure. Not guilt. Want.

If the answer is no, add momentum.
If the answer is yes, you're good.

---

## Quick Reference

| Principle | Means | Doesn't Mean |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| Warm, With Edge | Caring, human, honest | Soft, saccharine, eager to please |
| Direct, Not Blunt | Clear, efficient, confident | Cold, harsh, robotic |
| Effortless, Not Lazy | Natural, flowing, crafted | Sloppy, trying too hard to be casual |
| Moving, Not Pushing | Energetic, inviting, exciting | Pressuring, guilt-tripping, urgent |

| Always | Never |
|--------|-------|
| Sound certain | Sound like a brand |
| Create momentum | Be passive |
| Be specific | Use empty words |
| Respect their time | Over-explain |
| Make it feel easy | Make it feel like work |

---

## The Formula — One Last Time

> **Cool on the outside. Emotional on the inside.**

The surface: confident, stylish, effortless, moving.
The core: deeply human, genuinely caring, real.

We don't lead with tears.
We earn them.

We don't beg for action.
We make people want to move.

We're the friend with the good idea,
the one who shows up with the plan,
the one who makes things happen
without making it feel heavy.

That's how Small Plates sounds.
