# How Positioning Connects to Brand Idea

Positioning is not the Brand Idea. It's how the Brand Idea meets the market.

| Element | What It Is | Small Plates |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Brand Idea** | The deepest truth we represent | Vivid Presence |
| **Positioning** | How we occupy space in the market | The wedding gift that keeps everyone present |
| **Brand Line** | Poetic expression of the idea | "Still at the table" |
| **Acquisition Line** | Functional explanation | "Recipes from the people who love you" |

The Brand Idea is internal—it guides decisions. Positioning is external—it guides perception.

# The Five Positioning Questions

Positioning answers five fundamental questions. Here's how Small Plates answers each.

---

## 1. Who Is This For?

### The Audience Ecosystem

Small Plates has multiple audiences, but positioning must focus on the **emotional center**—the person whose approval validates the purchase.

| Role | Who | Function |
|------|-----|----------|
| **Transactional Buyer** | The Organizer (bridesmaid, sister, mother) | She pays. She coordinates. She executes. |
| **Emotional Buyer** | The Bride (as receiver) | She validates. She shares. She creates word-of-mouth. |
| **Contributors** | Wedding Guests | They participate. They become the content. They are the presence. |
| **Influencers** | Mother, Planner, Groom | They advise, recommend, approve, or veto. |

### The Strategic Insight

The Organizer is the transactional buyer—she makes the purchase. But the **Bride is the positioning target**. If the Bride wouldn't want it, the Organizer won't buy it.

The Bride is the taste filter. She determines whether Small Plates is "cool" or "cheesy." Every positioning choice must pass through her.

### Positioning Target Statement

> **Couples who want their wedding to mean something beyond the day—and the people who love them enough to make that possible.**

This captures both the emotional buyer (the couple) and the transactional buyer (the people around them) in one statement.

---

## 2. What Are We?

### Three Levels of "What"

Most brands describe themselves at the category level. Strong brands describe themselves at the meaning level.

| Level | Description | Small Plates |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Category** | What shelf we sit on | A collaborative wedding cookbook |
| **Functional** | What the product does | A recipe book made by wedding guests, designed as a gift for the couple |
| **Meaningful** | What it means to your life | A way for the people who showed up to stay in your life |

### The Meaningful Definition

> **Small Plates is how the people at your wedding become part of your marriage.**

This is the definition that connects to Vivid Presence. The product isn't a book—it's a mechanism for ongoing presence.

### What We Are Not

Clarity requires knowing what we are *not*:

| We Are Not | Why |
|------------|-----|
| A keepsake | Keepsakes are stored; we're used |
| A photo album | Photo albums are looked at; we're cooked from |
| A memory book | Memory is past-tense; presence is now |
| A registry item | Registry items are transactional; we're relational |
| A wedding favor | Favors are forgettable; we're permanent |
| A DIY project | DIY is a burden; we're a service |

---

## 3. What's the Alternative? (And Why Is It Worse?)

### The Competitive Landscape

Small Plates competes across multiple categories:

| Category | Examples | What They Offer | What They Lack |
|----------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Cash Funds | Zola, Honeyfund | Convenience, flexibility | No presence—just money that disappears into life |
| Registry Items | Amazon, Crate & Barrel | Utility, choice | No presence—objects without meaning |
| Photo Books | Artifact Uprising, Mixbook | Beautiful memories | Passive presence—you look, you don't live |
| DIY Recipe Books | Create Cookbooks, Heritage | Collaboration | No design, no completion, no quality |
| Personalized Gifts | The Night Sky, Etsy | Customization | Single-voice, symbolic, not functional |

### The Cultural Alternative

But our real competition isn't another product. It's a **condition**.

> **After the wedding, everyone goes home.**
>
> The flowers die. The dress gets boxed. The photos go into an album that gets opened less and less each year. The guests become people you see at holidays—if that. Their presence at your wedding becomes a memory that fades.
>
> **That's the alternative to Small Plates: the natural disappearance of presence.**

### Why This Frame Matters

Positioning against specific competitors (Artifact Uprising, Zola) makes us reactive. Positioning against a **cultural condition** (the disappearance of presence) makes us essential.

We're not saying "we're better than photo albums." We're saying "without us, the people who showed up for your wedding slowly fade from your daily life."

### The Competitive Frame

| Traditional Frame | Small Plates Frame |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| "Better than photo albums" | "The people stay present" |
| "More meaningful than cash" | "Presence that doesn't disappear" |
| "Easier than DIY" | "Done-for-you, so the presence actually happens" |

---

## 4. What Do We Uniquely Offer?

### The Attribute Comparison

| Attribute | Cash Funds | Registry Items | Photo Books | DIY Recipe Books | Small Plates |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|--------------|
| Collaborative | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (painful) | ✓ (easy) |
| Functional | — | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Emotional | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Permanent | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Done-for-you | ✓ | ✓ | Partial | ✗ | ✓ |
| Vivid Presence | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **✓** |

### The Unique Offer

Only Small Plates delivers **Vivid Presence**—the combination of collaboration, function, and emotional depth that keeps people actively present in your life.

> **The people who were at your wedding stay in your life—not as a memory you revisit, but as a presence you live with. Every recipe is a person. Every meal is a quiet reunion.**

### The Differentiation Hierarchy

| Level | What Others Can Claim | What Only We Can Claim |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Category** | "Wedding cookbook" | — |
| **Features** | "Collaborative," "Premium quality" | — |
| **Benefit** | "Meaningful gift" | — |
| **Meaning** | — | **"Keeps everyone present"** |

Features can be copied. Meaning cannot.

## 5. Why Should Anyone Believe Us?

### Proof Points

The positioning claim—"keeps everyone present"—requires proof. Here's what makes it credible:

| Proof Point | What It Demonstrates |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **The book lives in the kitchen** | Presence is daily, not ceremonial. You encounter it while cooking, not while reminiscing. |
| **Every recipe has a name and a note** | Presence is specific, not anonymous. Each contributor is identified. |
| **The book is designed to be used** | Presence is active, not preserved. Stains and wear are signs of life, not damage. |
| **Professional design, done-for-you** | The experience matches the promise. This isn't a DIY project that gets abandoned. |
| **Contributors write personal notes** | The presence has voice. It's not just a recipe—it's a person speaking. |
| **The book lasts for years** | Presence endures. This isn't a consumable; it's a permanent fixture. |

### The Reason to Believe (RTB)

> **Small Plates creates presence because the book lives where life happens—in the kitchen—and every page carries a specific person: their name, their recipe, their words. It's not designed to be preserved. It's designed to be used. And through use, the presence stays vivid.**

---

# Positioning by Audience

The core positioning adapts for different audiences while maintaining the same essence.

---

## For The Bride (As Receiver)

**Her question:** "Is this cool? Is this something I'd actually want?"

**Positioning for her:**

> This isn't another registry gift that ends up in a closet. It's a cookbook made by the people who showed up to your wedding—their recipes, their notes, their presence. You'll cook from it on random Tuesday nights. You'll see their names while you're making dinner. They're still there. Still at the table.

**Key message:** The people stay present in your daily life.

---

## For The Organizer (Bridesmaid, Sister, Mother)

**Her question:** "Is this the gift that makes me the hero?"

**Positioning for her:**

> You want to give something that actually matters—not another thing that gets returned or forgotten. Small Plates is different. Everyone contributes a recipe. We turn it into a beautiful book. She'll have it in her kitchen for decades. And every time she cooks from it, she'll think of the people who made it—including you.

**Key message:** This gift keeps giving. And you made it happen.

---

## For The Contributors (Guests)

**Their question:** "Why should I bother? This sounds like work."

**Positioning for them:**

> Five minutes. One recipe. You're not just giving a gift—you're staying in their life. Your recipe becomes a page in their kitchen. Your name, your note, your presence—there every time they cook it. This is how you show up beyond the wedding.

**Key message:** Five minutes now. Presence forever.

---

## For The Mother

**Her question:** "Is this serious or just trendy?"

**Positioning for her:**

> This isn't a trend. It's a hardcover book, professionally printed, made to last decades. Filled with recipes from everyone who was there—family recipes that might otherwise be lost. It's how the wedding becomes part of their home. How everyone who came stays part of their life.

**Key message:** Permanence. Substance. Legacy.

---

## For The Groom

**His question:** "Is this cheesy?"

**Positioning for him:**

> It's a cookbook. Real recipes from people you actually know. You'll use it on weeknights. Nothing cheesy about that.

**Key message:** Practical, not sentimental.

---

# Competitive Positioning Statements

When directly compared to alternatives, here's how we position:

---

## vs. Cash Funds

> Cash disappears into your bank account. Small Plates stays in your kitchen. One is a transaction. The other is a presence.

---

## vs. Registry Items

> A KitchenAid is a tool. Small Plates is the people who gave it meaning. One helps you cook. The other reminds you why cooking together matters.

---

## vs. Photo Albums

> Photo albums are memories you look at. Small Plates is presence you live with. One sits on a shelf. The other lives in your kitchen.

---

## vs. DIY Recipe Books

> You could spend 10+ hours chasing recipes, designing pages, and hoping it gets done. Or you could let us handle it—and guarantee it's beautiful. Same idea. Different experience.

---

## vs. Doing Nothing

> After the wedding, everyone goes home. The flowers die. The guests become memories. Unless you give them a reason to stay. Small Plates is that reason.

---

# Positioning Consistency Rules

## Always Lead With Meaning

| Don't Say | Say Instead |
|-----------|-------------|
| "A collaborative wedding cookbook" | "A cookbook made by everyone who loves you" |
| "A premium hardcover book" | "A book that lives in your kitchen for decades" |
| "Features recipes from guests" | "Keeps the people who showed up in your life" |

## Always Connect to Presence

Every positioning statement should answer: **"How does this keep people present?"**

If the statement doesn't connect to presence, revise it until it does.

## Never Position on Features Alone

Features (collaboration, professional design, premium printing) are proof points, not positioning. They support the claim; they don't make the claim.

| Feature | How to Position It |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Guests contribute recipes" | "The people who showed up become part of your kitchen" |
| "Professional design" | "Beautiful enough to display, durable enough to use" |
| "Done-for-you service" | "We make sure the presence actually happens" |

---

# The Positioning Test

Before any external communication, ask:

| Question | Required Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| Does this connect to Vivid Presence? | Yes |
| Does this answer "why should I care?" | Yes |
| Would Margot Cole say this with a knowing smile? | Yes |
| Does this differentiate from all alternatives? | Yes |
| Is this about meaning, not just features? | Yes |

If any answer is "No," revise before publishing.
