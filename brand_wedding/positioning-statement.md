# Positioning — Weddings

For brides and the people around them —
the ones who actually know her, not just her registry —

Small Plates is the wedding cookbook
made by the guests who matter most.

Every person contributes a recipe.
Every recipe becomes a page.
Every page becomes a reason to cook together.

Unlike photo books that live on shelves,
gifts that live in closets,
or registries that live in carts —

Small Plates lives in the kitchen.

Where the marriage actually happens.
