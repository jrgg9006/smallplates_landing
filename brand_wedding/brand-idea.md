**Still at the table.**

---

The wedding ends.
The guests go home.
The flowers die.
The dress gets boxed.

But every time they open the book,
every time they cook a recipe,
every time they read a name—

You're still there.

Still at the table.
Still part of the meal.
Still inside the home they're building.

Small Plates doesn't freeze a moment.
It extends a presence.
