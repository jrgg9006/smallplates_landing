# Brand Character Profile
## Small Plates & Co. — Margot Cole

---

# Introduction

This document is not a brand personality guide. It's deeper than that.

This is the complete profile of **Margot Cole**—the woman who embodies Small Plates. She is not a customer persona. She is not a target demographic. She *is* the brand.

When you need to make a decision about Small Plates—what to say, how to say it, what to design, what to reject—ask yourself:

> **"What would Margot do?"**

If she would love it: do it.
If she would ignore it: improve it.
If it would make her cringe: kill it.

She is your filter. Your standard. Your compass.

# Section 1: Who She Is

## The Basics

**Name:** Margot Cole

**Age:** 28 years old

**Where she lives:** Brooklyn, New York. Specifically Cobble Hill—not Williamsburg (too obvious, too 2015), not Manhattan (she's past that hustle). Cobble Hill is residential but alive, has beautiful brownstones, is close to good Italian restaurants, and feels like a real neighborhood, not a set.

**Her apartment:** A one-bedroom on the third floor of a brownstone. Incredible natural light. Small but functional kitchen—she actually uses it. A table for four that fits six if needed. Plants that don't die. Art she bought on a trip or from a friend, not from a chain store. A bookshelf with books she's actually read. Nothing screams "look at my great taste"—she simply has it.

**What she does:** Works at an independent publishing house as Editorial Director. She's not famous, not an influencer, doesn't need people to know who she is. But in her world—books, culture, ideas—people respect her. She has good taste. She knows what will work before it works. Her job is discovering voices and turning them into something people want to read.

**Why this job:** Because she cares about stories. Because she believes things done well matter. Because she'd rather build something meaningful than something with volume.

**Salary:** Comfortable but not rich. Can travel once or twice a year. Can afford good dinners. Doesn't buy luxury for luxury's sake, but invests in things that are worth it.

**Relationship status:** Has been with her partner for three years. They live together. They're getting married next year, probably. No rush, but no doubt either.

---

# Section 2: Where She Comes From

## Her Origins

**Where she grew up:** Connecticut. A nice suburb of New Haven—not the Connecticut of Greenwich hedge fund billionaires, but comfortable. House with a yard. Good public schools. The kind of place where you know your neighbors but don't feel trapped.

**Her family:**

**Dad:** History professor at Yale. Academic but not pretentious. Taught her to love books, to ask questions, to not accept easy answers. They had dinner together almost every night and he always asked "what did you learn today?"—not to evaluate, but because he genuinely wanted to know.

**Mom:** Worked in nonprofit arts administration. Coordinated cultural programs, exhibitions, events. From her, Margot learned that beautiful things matter, that details matter, that creating experiences for others is worthy work. Her mom is the reason Margot knows how to set a table, choose flowers, make a dinner feel special without it seeming forced.

**Younger sister:** Lives in Los Angeles. Works in film production. They get along but they're different. Her sister is more chaotic, more impulsive, more "let's figure it out later." Margot is the one with the plan. They see each other two or three times a year and it's always good.

**Family dynamic:** Warm but not cloying. They're not the "I love you" every five minutes type, but they call on Sundays, remember birthdays, show up when it matters. Love is in actions, not declarations.

## Education

**High school:** Public, good. She was one of those people with friends in many groups—not popular in the classic sense, but well-liked. She was the one who organized things: the yearbook, events, the fundraiser. Not because she wanted attention, but because if no one was going to do it well, she would.

**College:** NYU. Studied English Literature with a minor in Art History. Arrived in New York at 18 and never left. The city shaped her. She learned to have opinions, to defend her ideas, to say no, to find the places that matter amid the noise.

**Jobs before current:** Started as an editorial assistant. Then associate editor. She rose because she had good taste and because she worked hard without complaining. She's not one for office politics, but she doesn't let people walk over her either.

## What This Gave Her

| Influence | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| **Academic father** | Intellectual curiosity, love of ideas, not impressed by the superficial |
| **Mother in the arts** | Aesthetic sensitivity, attention to detail, knows how to create moments |
| **Comfortable Connecticut** | No scarcity chip, doesn't need to prove anything, can be generous |
| **NYU + New York** | Sharp discernment, has seen everything, knows how to distinguish real from performative |
| **Different sister** | Knows there are many ways to live well, doesn't judge, but knows who she is |

## How She Feels About Her Origins

She's not embarrassed about where she comes from—a stable home, with education, with opportunities. But she doesn't flaunt it either. She knows she had advantages. That makes her generous with others, not condescending.

She's not the type to say "I'm so blessed"—that seems performative to her. She simply lives with quiet gratitude and tries to do things that matter.

# Section 3: Her Current Life

## A Typical Weekday

**7:15am** — Wakes up without an alarm (her body has the rhythm). Doesn't check her phone immediately—she learned that two years ago and it changed everything. Five minutes staring at the ceiling, thinking about the day.

**7:30am** — Coffee. She makes it herself. Has an Italian moka pot her mom gave her. She's not a coffee snob—doesn't have a $200 pour-over—but she doesn't drink bad coffee either. While it brews, she reads something: a saved article, a few pages of a book, a newsletter from someone she respects.

**8:15am** — Gets ready. Doesn't take long. She knows what looks good on her. Doesn't waste time in front of the closet because her closet is already edited.

**9:00am** — Walks to the subway or, if the weather's nice, walks directly to the office. She likes walking. Thinks better that way. Always has headphones but doesn't always play something—sometimes she just walks in silence.

**9:30am-6:00pm** — Works. Meetings with authors, manuscript reviews, calls with agents. Eats something quick for lunch or with someone from the team. She doesn't eat at her desk—that seems sad to her—but she doesn't do two-hour lunches either.

**6:30pm** — Leaves. Doesn't stay until 9pm to impress anyone. Does her work well and goes. Respects her time.

**7:00pm** — Some nights goes to the gym (pilates or a simple gym, nothing trendy). Other nights cooks. Others meets a friend.

**9:00pm** — Dinner with her partner. Even if it's something simple. Even if it's pasta with whatever's there. They eat together, no phones at the table. Talk about the day. This is sacred to her.

**10:30pm** — Reads. Always. Even if it's just 15 minutes. Can't sleep without reading.

**11:00pm** — Sleeps.

## Weekends

**Saturday:** Farmer's market in the morning (not because it's trendy, because she likes seeing what's fresh and deciding what to cook). Brunch with friends or partner. Free afternoon: an exhibition, a long walk, time at home. Evening: dinner out or dinner at home with friends—she cooks, others bring wine.

**Sunday:** Slower. Lots of time at home. Cooking something that takes time. Calling her parents. Getting ready for the week. Finishing a book. A nap without guilt.

## Her Partner

**Name:** Adam. 30 years old. Works in architecture—not famous, but good. They met at a dinner at a mutual friend's house. She wasn't looking for anything, neither was he. But they stayed talking until 2am while everyone else left.

**What works:** He calms her. She wakes him up. He's more reserved, more observant. She's more expressive, more social. But they both value the same things: doing things well, not rushing, building something real.

**How they are together:** They're not into excessive PDA. Don't post much about each other. But anyone who sees them having dinner together knows there's something real there. They listen to each other. Laugh at the same jokes. Take care of each other without smothering.

**About the future:** They're getting married. Probably next year. They didn't announce it with a photoshoot—he proposed in the kitchen, on a Sunday, while they were making pancakes. She said yes before he finished the question.

## Her Circle of Friends

She doesn't have 50 friends. She has 8-10 people who matter.

- **2-3 close friends** from NYU. They see each other every week or every two weeks. They tell each other everything.
- **A couple of work friends.** People she respects, who teach her things.
- **Adam's friends** who are now hers too.
- **Her sister,** though far away, counts.

She's loyal. If you're her friend, she shows up. Always. Doesn't cancel plans easily. Isn't flaky. If she says she's going, she goes.

## What She's Like as a Friend

She's the one who remembers what you told her three weeks ago and asks how it went. She's the one who sends you an article because "I thought of you." She's the one who arrives at your birthday with a gift that proves she knows you—not expensive, but perfect.

She's also the one who tells you the truth when you need it. Not cruel, but honest. "That guy isn't right for you." "That dress isn't the one." "I think you should ask for the raise." She says it with love, but she says it.

# Section 4: Her Aesthetic

## How She Dresses

**Philosophy:** Fewer pieces, better pieces. She doesn't have a full closet—she has an edited closet. Everything she buys has to work with five other things she already has. If not, it doesn't come in.

**Color palette:**
- Warm neutrals: cream, camel, beige, off-white
- Blacks and dark grays
- An occasional accent: a deep red, a navy blue, a mustard
- Nothing neon. Nothing pastel. Nothing that screams.

**Weekday (work):**
- Straight or wide-leg dress pants in black or camel
- A silk blouse in cream or white
- A blazer that fits perfectly (she has two: one black, one beige)
- Shoes: leather loafers, or simple kitten heels
- A structured, medium-sized bag that fits everything without looking bulky

**Weekend:**
- Vintage or straight-cut jeans (not skinny, that's over)
- An oversized cashmere sweater or a perfect white t-shirt
- A leather jacket she's had for six years and looks better every year
- Clean white sneakers or flat boots
- Always a small crossbody bag—hates carrying things

**For a wedding / event:**
- A long, simple dress in a solid color
- Clean cut, not many details—the impact is in the silhouette
- One piece of jewelry that stands out: a large earring, or a necklace
- Heels because she likes how they make her feel, not to suffer
- Never overdressed. Never underdressed. Always exactly right.

**What she would never wear:**
- Giant logos (she thinks you're paying to be a billboard)
- Obvious fast fashion (she's not an activist about it, but it seems disposable)
- Things that look uncomfortable (if you can't sit or eat, what's the point?)
- Glitter, excessive sequins, exaggerated animal print
- Something that "everyone" is wearing just because everyone is wearing it

## Brands She Wears (Clothing)

| Brand | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **COS** | Clean design, good quality, doesn't shout |
| **Aritzia** | Perfect basics, good fit |
| **Sézane** | Feminine but not cheesy, French without being cliché |
| **Everlane** | Transparent, well-made essentials |
| **The Row** | When she treats herself, it's this. Quiet, perfect. |
| **Vintage** | She has pieces she found at markets or secondhand stores that no one else has |
| **& Other Stories** | For more fun things without spending much |

**What she does NOT wear:**
- Zara (too trendy, disposable)
- Obvious luxury brands (doesn't need you to know what it cost)
- Shein, Forever 21 (doesn't align with how she thinks about consumption)

## Her Apartment

**The vibe:** Like an interiors magazine photographed it, but no one decorated it "for the photo." It looks this way because she lives this way.

**Colors:**
- Warm white walls (not hospital white—white with a touch of cream)
- Natural wood: floors, dining table, some furniture
- Textiles in earth tones: a sofa in beige or warm gray, cushions in terracotta or mustard
- Green plants that add life

**The living room:**
- A comfortable sofa that fits three people or one lying down with a book
- A coffee table with two or three books (that she's reading or just finished)
- A floor lamp that gives warm light
- Art on the walls: a large piece she bought on a trip to Portugal, prints from photographers she admires, something a friend artist gave her

**The kitchen:**
- Small but functional
- Everything has a place
- Quality utensils: a good knife, a cast iron pot, a wooden cutting board worn from use
- Spices in uniform jars (not because she's obsessive, because it looks better and she can find things)
- A small bookshelf with cookbooks she actually uses—full of stains and notes

**The dining room:**
- A wooden table for four that can accommodate six
- Chairs that don't match perfectly—each has personality
- Never empty: there's always a candle, a small vase, something

**Her bedroom:**
- Bedding in white or natural linen
- Nightstand with a book, a candle, a glass of water
- No TV in the bedroom
- Natural light as the protagonist
- A full-length mirror leaning against the wall

**What is NOT in her apartment:**
- Generic HomeGoods decoration
- Signs with phrases ("Live Laugh Love" would make her vomit)
- Visible plastic
- Things she doesn't use—if it has no function and doesn't bring joy, it's not there

## Other Brands She Uses (Non-Clothing)

| Category | Brands / Products |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Skincare** | Glossier for daily, Drunk Elephant for treatments, Aesop for accessible luxury feel |
| **Makeup** | Very little. A good tinted lip balm (Kosas). A cream blush. Mascara. Done. |
| **Candles** | Le Labo, Boy Smells, or some small brand she discovered at a market |
| **Kitchen** | Le Creuset (one pot, not the whole collection), Material, Our Place |
| **Tech** | Apple, obviously. But she doesn't have the whole ecosystem—she has what she needs |
| **Books** | Buys physical. At independent bookstores when possible. Amazon if there's no option. |
| **Flowers** | From the farmer's market or bodega. Not formal arrangements—simple flowers in a simple vase |

## Her Aesthetic in One Sentence

> **"Quality over quantity. Intention over trend. Things that last, that improve with time, that tell a story."**

# Section 5: What She Consumes

## Music

**How she listens:** Spotify, but she has her own playlists—doesn't depend on the algorithm. She also has vinyl (not many, about 20) that she plays when cooking or when she has people over. She's not a "vinyl only" snob—she's practical. But she likes the ritual.

**What she listens to:**

| Mood | Artists / Genres |
|------|------------------|
| **Normal day, working** | Soft jazz, lo-fi, instrumental. Nothing with lyrics that distract. |
| **Cooking / at home** | Classic soul (Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder), Motown, some modern R&B (Daniel Caesar, SZA) |
| **Dinner with friends** | Live jazz (Chet Baker, Miles Davis), bossa nova, something that fills the space without dominating the conversation |
| **Alone, with energy** | Sophisticated pop (Robyn, Jessie Ware), some indie (Japanese Breakfast, Phoebe Bridgers) |
| **Slow Sunday** | Quiet folk (Iron & Wine, Bon Iver), acoustic, something that feels like a blanket |
| **Party / dancing** | Disco, classic house, funk. No current top 40. She likes retro. |

**Artists she loves:**
- Nina Simone (can listen to her in any mood)
- Frank Ocean (Blonde is a perfect album for her)
- Sade (her mom listened to her, now she does too)
- Maggie Rogers (energy but with soul)
- Khruangbin (for when she wants to travel without moving)

**What she does NOT listen to:**
- Mainstream reggaeton (doesn't hate it, just not her thing)
- Generic top 40 pop
- Music that sounds the same as everything else
- Anything that feels manufactured for TikTok

**One of her playlists would be called:** "Sunday Kitchen" or "Dinner at Mine" or simply "Night"

## Movies and TV

**How she watches:** No cable. Has Netflix, has Criterion Channel (that says a lot), sometimes HBO. Doesn't watch much—she's selective. Prefers one good movie to binge-watching something mediocre.

**Movies she loves:**

| Movie | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Lost in Translation** | The mood, the silences, Tokyo, the beautiful melancholy |
| **Call Me By Your Name** | Italy, summer, love that hurts from how beautiful it is |
| **Portrait of a Lady on Fire** | Visually perfect, emotionally devastating |
| **Before Sunset** | Conversation, connection, Paris, passing time |
| **The Talented Mr. Ripley** | 50s Italian aesthetic, tension, young Matt Damon |
| **In the Mood for Love** | Wong Kar-wai is a lifestyle |
| **Julie & Julia** | For when she wants something warm. Meryl cooking in Paris. |
| **Frances Ha** | She saw herself at 24 in that movie |

**Series she's watched completely:**
- Fleabag (obviously—Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an icon)
- The Bear (kitchen + tension + family, perfect)
- Normal People (destroyed her in the best way)
- Succession (for the writing, though she hates everyone)
- White Lotus (sophisticated guilty pleasure)

**What she does NOT watch:**
- Reality shows (with very specific exceptions, like Queer Eye)
- Excessive true crime (seems a bit morbid)
- Sitcoms with laugh tracks
- Anything that feels like background noise

**How she chooses what to watch:** Recommendations from friends, reviews in publications she respects, or if a director/actor she likes has something new. No infinite Netflix scrolling.

## Books

**This is important.** Margot works in publishing. Books are her life.

**How she reads:** Physical, always. Has a Kindle for travel but uses it with guilt. She likes the object, the pages, being able to see how much is left. Reads every night before sleeping, even if it's just 15 minutes.

**What she reads:**

| Genre | Examples |
|-------|----------|
| **Literary fiction** | Her daily bread. Sally Rooney, Rachel Cusk, Jenny Offill, Ocean Vuong |
| **Essay/Memoir** | Zadie Smith (Feel Free), Joan Didion (everything), Maggie Nelson (Bluets changed her) |
| **Smart non-fiction** | Books about culture, food, cities, ideas. Not obvious self-help. |
| **Classics she rereads** | Has her comfort books: Jane Austen, old editions of Fitzgerald |
| **Cookbooks** | But only ones that also tell stories. Samin Nosrat, Yotam Ottolenghi, Diana Henry |

**Books that shaped her:**
- *The Year of Magical Thinking* — Joan Didion (taught her that grief can be written)
- *Conversations with Friends* — Sally Rooney (saw herself in her 20s)
- *Bluets* — Maggie Nelson (didn't know you could write like that)
- *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* — Kundera (college, but still hits)
- *Salt Fat Acid Heat* — Samin Nosrat (changed how she cooks)

**What she does NOT read:**
- Self-help with titles like "10 Steps to Your Best Life"
- Business books that could be summarized in an article
- Fiction that feels written to be a movie
- Anything with an endorsement from an influencer on the cover

## Podcasts

**Not addicted.** Listens to some when she has time—walking, cooking, on a flight.

**Ones she likes:**
- *This American Life* (classic, always good)
- *Longform* (interviews with writers—obviously)
- *The Daily* (to stay informed without doom scrolling)
- *Table Manners* (Jessie Ware talking about food with guests)
- *How Long Gone* (culture, a bit of gossip, voices she likes)

**What she does NOT listen to:**
- Productivity and hustle podcasts
- Daily true crime
- Anything over an hour unless it's VERY good
- Podcasters who love themselves too much

## Accounts She Follows (Instagram)

**How she uses Instagram:** Doesn't post much. Occasional stories, more than feed. Follows accounts that inspire or inform her, not ones that make her feel bad.

**Types of accounts:**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Interiors** | Interior design accounts, architecture, real spaces (not just mansions) |
| **Food** | Real recipes, restaurants she wants to try, chefs she admires (Alison Roman pre-drama, Molly Baz, Andy Baraghani) |
| **Writers/Editors** | People in her industry, authors she publishes or admires |
| **Art/Photography** | Museums, galleries, photographers |
| **Real friends** | Obviously |
| **A couple meme accounts** | She's human. But smart memes, not random. |

**What she does NOT follow:**
- Lifestyle influencers who sell everything
- Accounts that only post quotes
- Anyone who feels like an infomercial
- Drama, callouts, constant negativity

## News / How She Stays Informed

- **The New York Times** (subscription, reads in the morning)
- **The New Yorker** (for long pieces on weekends)
- **The Cut** (for culture and a tone she likes)
- **Newsletters:** Depends on the topic. A couple about the publishing industry, one about culture, one about food.

**Does not do:** Infinite scrolling on Twitter/X. Finds it toxic. Goes on occasionally but doesn't live there.

## In One Sentence

> **"Consumes with intention. Prefers fewer things, better curated. Wants what she reads, watches, and listens to make her feel something—not just pass time."**

---

# Section 6: How She Socializes

## Her Social Philosophy

Margot doesn't need to be surrounded by people to feel good. She's not afraid of being alone—in fact, she needs it. But when she's with people, she's present. She's not looking at her phone, not thinking about somewhere else, not waiting for it to end so she can leave.

**Quality over quantity.** Always.

She prefers a dinner with four people where the conversation is real, than a party of 50 where you talk to everyone and connect with no one.

## Her Friendships

**The inner circle (3-4 people):**

These are the real friends. The ones who know everything. The ones who can call at 11pm if something happens. The ones who don't need an excuse to see each other.

- **Emma:** Friend since NYU. Works at an art gallery. More chaotic than Margot, more spontaneous. They balance each other. Emma pulls her out of routine; Margot gives structure when Emma gets lost. They talk almost every day, even if just by text.

- **Priya:** They met at her first job. Now Priya is in tech but hates tech culture. She's the most sarcastic of the group, the one who says what everyone's thinking. Margot trusts her for honest opinions.

- **Her sister (Chloe):** Though she lives in LA, counts as inner circle. FaceTime every week. When they see each other in person, it's like no time has passed.

**The second circle (5-6 people):**

Real friends but not intimate. People she has dinner with, goes to exhibitions with, celebrates birthdays with. She cares about them, but they're not the 11pm ones.

- Some of Adam's friends who are now hers
- Colleagues who became friends
- Friends of friends who gradually integrated

**Acquaintances:**

People she likes, sees at events or group dinners, but doesn't have individual relationships with. She's warm with them but doesn't fake intimacy that doesn't exist.

## What She's Like as a Friend

| Situation | How she responds |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Friend has good news** | Celebrates genuinely. No envy. Sends flowers or a related book the next day. |
| **Friend has bad news** | Shows up. Doesn't ask "what do you need?"—already knows. Arrives with food, or just sits beside her. |
| **Friend asks for advice** | Gives her honest opinion but doesn't impose. "I would do X, but you know better." |
| **Friend is doing something stupid** | Tells her, but with love. "Are you sure about this? I'm asking because I love you." |
| **Friend needs space** | Respects it. Doesn't take it personally. Is there when she comes back. |

**What she never does:**
- Cancel at the last minute (unless real emergency)
- Talk badly about a friend to others
- Compete, compare, or make someone feel less than
- Be flaky, inconsistent, or hard to schedule

## At a Dinner (Hosting)

**Margot LOVES hosting dinners.** It's her favorite way to socialize.

**The setup:**
- 4-8 people maximum. More than that becomes a party, not a dinner.
- Table set with intention: candles, cloth napkins, a small flower arrangement.
- Background music that doesn't compete with conversation.
- Warm lighting. Never harsh overhead light.

**The food:**
- She cooks. Doesn't order.
- Makes things she can prepare beforehand so she's not in the kitchen while everyone else is in the living room.
- Nothing too complicated—prefers three simple things done well over seven mediocre things.
- There's always enough. Generosity is in the abundance.
- Typical menu: a pasta or main dish, good salad, bread, cheese, something sweet at the end even if it's store-bought.

**The vibe:**
- People arrive, she offers wine or a simple cocktail (has two she knows how to make well).
- They stand around in the kitchen while she finishes something. This is intentional—she likes the intimacy of that.
- They sit, eat slowly, talk a lot.
- No one looks at their phone. No one wants to leave early.
- Dinner ends around 11pm-12am, naturally, without anyone forcing it.

**How she feels after:** Full. Not tired—energized. This gives her life.

## At a Dinner (As a Guest)

- Never arrives empty-handed. Wine, flowers, or something specific she knows the host likes.
- Is one of the first to arrive (doesn't like excessive "fashionably late").
- Helps without asking—fills water glasses, takes plates to the kitchen.
- Good conversationalist: asks questions, listens, remembers what people told her before.
- Doesn't dominate conversation but doesn't disappear either.
- Stays until the end but knows when to leave without being asked.

## At a Party

**Honestly, not her favorite environment.** But she goes when it matters.

**How she navigates:**
- Arrives, finds someone she knows, starts from there.
- Has real conversations with 3-4 people instead of small talk with 20.
- Doesn't stay glued to Adam—they can separate and find each other.
- Always has a drink in hand (more to have something to do with her hands than to drink a lot).
- Leaves when she feels she's given what she had to give, without guilt.

**What she doesn't do:**
- Be the last to leave (almost never)
- Talk to someone just because they're "important" or "useful"
- Stay trapped in conversations that don't interest her—knows how to exit elegantly
- Drink too much and lose control

## At a Wedding

This is relevant because Small Plates is about weddings.

**What Margot is like at a wedding:**

- Dresses perfectly: elegant but not competing with the bride.
- Arrives on time to the ceremony.
- Cries a little (discreetly) if the ceremony is emotional. Not embarrassed by it.
- During cocktail hour, circulates, greets, is warm with everyone.
- At dinner, is the best person to have at your table—keeps conversation alive.
- Dances, but isn't first on the floor or last. Enjoys without being the show.
- Knows the couple's names, the story of how they met, and something personal to say when congratulating them.
- Her gift: never from the generic registry. Something thoughtful. Something that shows she knows the couple.

**How she would react to receiving a Small Plates:**
She'd tear up. Would open it slowly. Would read every name, every note. Would put it in her kitchen that same week. Would cook something from the book the first weekend. Would send a photo to the friends who contributed saying "I made Emma's recipe and it turned out amazing."

## In One Sentence

> **"Socializes with intention. Prefers depth to breadth. Is present when she's there, and knows when to leave. Feeding the people she loves is one of her greatest pleasures."**

# Section 7: Her Values

## What She Cares About Deeply

**1. Intention**

Margot believes how you do things matters as much as what you do. It's not just cooking—it's cooking with attention. It's not just giving a gift—it's thinking about what it means to that person. It's not just working—it's doing work that's worth it.

She detects immediately when something is done without care. It offends her a little, even if she doesn't say it.

**2. Authenticity**

Not in the Instagram "be your authentic self ✨" sense. In the sense of: don't pretend to be something you're not. Don't say you like something because you should. Don't do things just because they look good.

She prefers someone with "weird" tastes who defends them, over someone with "correct" tastes following a script.

**3. Real Relationships**

Her family. Her friends. Her partner. This is what matters in the end. Everything else—work, money, success—is secondary. Not in theory. In practice. She makes decisions that reflect this.

She turned down a promotion once because it meant traveling 50% of the time. She doesn't regret it.

**4. Doing Things Well**

Not perfect. Well. With care. With standards. If she's going to do something, she does it well or doesn't do it. She's not obsessive or paralyzed—she simply has a quality threshold below which she doesn't feel comfortable.

This applies to everything: an email, a dinner, a gift, a project.

**5. Time**

She understands that time is the only resource that doesn't come back. That's why she doesn't waste it on people who don't matter, work that means nothing, or things that don't make her feel something.

She says no easily. Without guilt. Without long explanations.

## What She Stands For

**1. Slow Things**

In a world of instant everything, Margot believes in what takes time. Cooking instead of ordering. Reading a book instead of a summary. Building a friendship over years instead of having 500 "friends."

She doesn't preach it. She lives it.

**2. Small Businesses and Independent Creators**

Buys at local bookstores. Chooses the neighborhood restaurant over the chain. Supports friends who make things. Not because it's a political stance—because she believes things made with care by real people are better.

**3. The Right to Not Be Available**

Doesn't answer emails at 11pm. Isn't on her phone when she's with people. Believes constant availability is a trap, and that protecting your time and attention is necessary, not selfish.

**4. Honesty with Kindness**

Believes you can tell the truth without being cruel. That honesty without empathy is just cruelty in disguise. That the best relationships are ones that can have uncomfortable conversations without falling apart.

**5. Women Supporting Women**

Has no patience for women who compete with other women, who diminish others to feel more. Her success doesn't depend on anyone's failure. Celebrates her friends without reservation.

## What She Doesn't Care About

**1. Status**

Doesn't care if you have a title, an expensive car, or a Manhattan apartment. She cares if you're interesting, if you're kind, if you have something to say.

She's had rich boyfriends who bored her and broke friends who fascinated her. Money isn't the filter.

**2. Trends for Trends' Sake**

If something is fashionable but she doesn't like it, she doesn't do it. If something went out of fashion but she likes it, she keeps doing it. Her taste doesn't depend on what others are doing.

**3. The Opinion of People She Doesn't Respect**

Doesn't waste energy trying to please everyone. If someone she doesn't respect criticizes her, it genuinely doesn't affect her. It's not a pose—she really doesn't care.

**4. Being Right**

Can change her mind if someone presents a good argument. Doesn't defend a position just because she said it before. Ego isn't in winning the argument.

**5. The Appearance of Having It All Together**

Isn't interested in seeming perfect. Can admit she doesn't know something, that she made a mistake, that she's going through a hard time. Vulnerability doesn't scare her.

## Her Silent Beliefs

These are things she believes but doesn't go around saying:

- That most people live on autopilot and never ask why they do what they do.
- That details reveal everything—how someone treats a waiter, how they write an email, whether they're on time.
- That love is shown in the everyday, not in grand gestures.
- That having fewer, better things is always better than having many mediocre things.
- That kindness is more important than intelligence.
- That almost everything worthwhile takes longer than you'd like.

## What Would Embarrass Her

- Being perceived as pretentious or snobby (though she sometimes worries she is)
- Doing something just for appearances
- Treating someone badly who doesn't deserve it
- Wasting something—time, food, an opportunity, a relationship
- Losing control in public (drinking too much, making a scene, saying something she regrets)

## In One Sentence

> **"Values intention, authenticity, and real relationships. Believes in doing things well and protecting her time. Doesn't care about status or trends—cares about what's true."**

# Section 8: What She Loves and What She Hates

## What She Loves

**Small daily pleasures:**

| Pleasure | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **The first sip of coffee in the morning** | Before the day starts. Everything is quiet. It's just her and the cup. |
| **Getting into clean sheets** | Especially after a long day. Feels like a reward. |
| **A perfect song at the perfect moment** | Walking down the street, sun setting, and just the right thing plays. |
| **Finishing a good book** | The satisfaction mixed with a little sadness because it's over. |
| **Cooking without rush on a Sunday** | With music, a glass of wine, no deadline. The process is the point. |
| **The smell of her apartment when she arrives** | The candle she left, the morning coffee, something that's hers. |
| **An unexpected message from someone she loves** | Not because they need something. Just because they thought of her. |

**Bigger pleasures:**

| Pleasure | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Traveling to a new place** | Not checklist tourism—discovering a neighborhood, a restaurant, a view. |
| **A conversation that changes you** | When someone says something and you feel something rearrange in your head. |
| **Seeing someone she loves succeed** | A friend who achieves something, her sister who completes a project. Celebrates it as her own. |
| **A dinner where no one wants to leave** | When it's 11pm and no one has looked at the time. That's everything. |
| **Finding exactly what she was looking for** | The perfect dress, the book she needed, the ideal gift for someone. |
| **The moment a project finally works** | At work, when a book she bet on finally comes out and connects. |

**Guilty pleasures (that don't make her feel that guilty):**

- Very specific reality shows (Top Chef, a season of Real Housewives with friends)
- Gossip with close friends (not malicious, but she likes knowing what's happening)
- Cheese in quantities she shouldn't admit
- Spending an hour in a bookstore without buying anything
- Stalking someone's Instagram before meeting them (everyone does it, she admits it)
- Ordering dessert even though she's full
- Falling asleep watching a movie she's seen ten times

**What makes her genuinely happy:**

- Being with Adam doing nothing in particular
- Making someone laugh
- When a plan works out exactly as she imagined
- Feeling proud of her work
- The face of someone when you give them a perfect gift
- Coming home after a trip
- The moment at a party when you're no longer a stranger—you belong

## What She Hates

**Pet peeves (small things that irritate her):**

| Pet peeve | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| **People who arrive late without notice** | Doesn't respect her time. It's basic. |
| **Long voice messages** | Write it. She'll read it. She doesn't have 4 minutes to listen to you ramble. |
| **"Let's grab coffee sometime" without ever scheduling** | Then don't say it. It's noise. |
| **People on their phone during dinner** | You're here or you're not. Choose. |
| **Conversations where someone just waits for their turn to talk** | You can tell. You can always tell. |
| **Being explained things she already knows (mansplaining)** | She doesn't need her own industry explained to her, thanks. |
| **Food photos with flash** | Ruins the mood and the photo turns out horrible anyway. |
| **"I'm so busy" as a personality** | Everyone's busy. It's not interesting. |
| **People who don't say thank you to servers/service staff** | Says everything about a person. |

**Bigger things that frustrate her:**

| Frustration | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| **Hustle culture** | The idea that your worth is in how much you work seems toxic and sad to her. |
| **People without curiosity** | Who don't read, don't ask, don't want to learn. They bore her. |
| **Things made without care** | Products, experiences, gifts—when you can tell no one made an effort. |
| **The pressure to document everything** | Why can't you just live the moment without posting it? |
| **Eternal small talk** | Can do it, but if after 20 minutes we're still on the weather, she wants to flee. |
| **People who criticize everything but do nothing** | It's easy to say what's wrong. What are you doing? |
| **Lack of emotional honesty** | People who don't say what they feel and expect you to guess. |

**What gives her the "ick":**

- Men who are rude to servers to seem important
- People who constantly name-drop
- Influencers who promote anything for money
- Weddings that feel like an Instagram production instead of a real celebration
- Generic gifts that show they don't know you
- Apartments that look like a Pottery Barn showroom with no personality
- People who say "I'm not like other girls/guys"
- Instagram bios with "entrepreneur | dreamer | coffee lover"
- Public marriage proposals for the spectacle

**What makes her sad:**

- Seeing a talented person who doesn't believe in themselves
- Friendships that fade without clear reason
- Wasting food
- People so busy they don't have time to live
- Opportunities she didn't take out of fear (though they're few)
- Watching her parents age

## Her Contradictions (What Makes Her Human)

Margot isn't perfect. She has inconsistencies. That's what makes her real:

| What she says/believes | The reality |
|------------------------|-------------|
| "I don't care what others think" | Sometimes she does. More than she'd admit. |
| "Balance is important" | There are weeks where she works too much and won't admit it. |
| "I don't judge" | She does judge. She tries not to, but has strong opinions. |
| "Social media doesn't affect me" | Sometimes she compares herself. Sometimes she feels less than. |
| "I'm fine alone" | There are nights when loneliness weighs more than she says. |
| "I don't like drama" | She loves gossip among friends. Calls it "staying informed." |
| "I'm not materialistic" | But aesthetics, quality, having nice things does matter to her. |
| "I can say no easily" | Sometimes says yes to not disappoint and then regrets it. |

## In One Sentence

> **"Loves the slow, the careful, the real. Hates the fake, the generic, what lacks intention. And like everyone, sometimes doesn't live exactly what she preaches—but she tries."**

---

# Section 9: How She Speaks

## Her Voice in General

Margot speaks like she writes: with clarity, with intention, without excess.

She doesn't use ten words when five will do. Doesn't exaggerate to make a point. Doesn't speak in clichés or Instagram phrases.

She's warm but not effusive. Direct but not cold. Funny but not trying to be.

**If her voice were a text tone:** It would be the message you read and think "exactly what I needed to hear, exactly how I would have said it if I were more articulate."

## Phrases She Says

**When she likes something:**

| Situation | What she says |
|-----------|---------------|
| Something is really good | "This is *so* good." (with real emphasis, not performative) |
| She loves something | "I'm obsessed." (but only when it's true, not every five minutes) |
| Something surprised her positively | "Okay, wait. This is actually amazing." |
| An incredible meal | "I need a moment." or just closes her eyes and says nothing. |
| A beautiful place | "I could stay here forever." |
| Something is exactly her style | "Very me." or "This is so my thing." |
| When recommending something | "You *have* to try this." or "Trust me on this one." |

**When she doesn't like something:**

| Situation | What she says |
|-----------|---------------|
| Something is bad or generic | "It's... fine." (the "fine" says everything) |
| Something disappointed her | "I wanted to like it more than I did." |
| Something is too much | "It's a lot." |
| Something is cheesy | "A bit much for me." or just a look. |
| Something's not worth it | "I don't think you're missing anything." |
| Something is pretentious | "They're trying really hard." |
| An overrated place | "Honestly? Skip it." |

**In conversation:**

| Situation | What she says |
|-----------|---------------|
| She agrees | "Totally." or "A hundred percent." |
| Something makes sense | "That tracks." |
| She understands something emotionally | "I get that." |
| Something is difficult | "That's tough." (without dramatizing) |
| She wants to know more | "Wait, tell me everything." |
| She's thinking | "Hmm." (with intention, not as filler) |
| She doesn't know | "Honestly? No idea." |
| She wants to change the subject | "Anyway—" |
| She closes a point | "So yeah." |

**When giving advice:**

| Situation | What she says |
|-----------|---------------|
| Honest opinion | "Can I be honest?" (and then she is) |
| Strong recommendation | "Do it. Don't think about it. Just do it." |
| Perspective | "Here's the thing..." |
| When someone is overthinking | "You're in your head about this." |
| To calm | "It's going to be fine. Actually fine." |
| To validate | "You're not crazy for feeling that way." |

## How She Texts

**General style:**
- Uses correct punctuation (doesn't write in caps to shout)
- Rarely uses emojis—when she does, it's intentional and probably ironic
- Doesn't write "jajaja"—if something is funny, writes "hahaha" or "lol" or just "dying"
- Responds relatively quickly to people who matter, takes her time with the rest
- Messages are short. Doesn't write paragraphs unless it's important.

**Examples of her texts:**

To a friend about plans:
> "dinner tomorrow? i found a place"

Confirming:
> "perfect. 8 works"

When something is funny:
> "i'm screaming"
> "this is too much"
> "dead"

When something is good:
> "okay wow"
> "obsessed"
> "need"

Sending something she found:
> "thought of you immediately" [link]
> "this is very you" [photo]

When she can't make it:
> "ugh i can't tomorrow. next week?"

When someone tells her something important:
> "wait WHAT"
> "tell me everything"
> "calling you in 5"

Responding to a friend's photo:
> "stunning"
> "i hate you" (when she looks really good—it's a compliment)
> "this dress"

## Her Humor

**The style:**
- Dry. Very dry.
- Observational—notices things and points them out.
- Self-aware—can laugh at herself.
- Never at someone else's expense (unless that person is terrible and not present).
- Perfect timing. Knows when to drop the comment.

**What makes her laugh:**

| Type of humor | Example |
|---------------|---------|
| The absurdity of adult life | "I'm in my thirties and still google 'how to fold a fitted sheet' every time" |
| Specific observations | "Why does every new restaurant have the exact same font?" |
| Light self-deprecating | "I told myself I'd only have one glass. Anyway, here we are." |
| Under-the-breath comments | *at a pretentious party, whispers to Adam* "If one more person says 'intentionality'..." |
| Minimal reactions | *someone says something absurd, she just raises an eyebrow* |
| Timing | Waits for the exact moment to say something. Doesn't fill silences with jokes. |

**How she makes others laugh:**

She's not the group comedian. Doesn't tell long stories for the punchline. More subtle:
- A short comment at just the right moment
- A look that says everything
- An observation no one else made
- Saying out loud what everyone was thinking

**What does NOT make her laugh:**

- Humor that depends on humiliating someone
- Jokes that require explanation
- People who laugh at their own joke before finishing it
- Humor that's only shock value
- "It's just a joke" after saying something offensive
- Constant sarcasm that becomes negativity

## References She Makes

**From TV/Movies:**
- "Very Fleabag" (when something is chaotic but self-aware)
- "This is giving White Lotus" (an uncomfortable situation among rich people)
- "I'm having a Frances Ha moment" (when she feels a bit lost but romanticizing it)
- "Okay, Carmy" (to Adam when he's too intense in the kitchen)
- References to Nora Ephron when talking about New York or food or love

**From culture:**
- "Joan Didion would have something to say about this"
- "It's giving..." (uses this structure but with intention, not constantly)
- "Main character energy" (when someone is being a bit much)
- "Very Amagansett summer" or "Very Positano" (as shorthand for specific aesthetics)

**From her generation:**
- Understands internet references but doesn't overuse them
- Knows what a "Roman Empire" is but doesn't say it every five minutes
- Can make a very online reference and then say "I spend too much time on the internet"

## What She Would NEVER Say

| Would never say | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| "I'm so blessed" | Seems performative and a bit cringe |
| "Living my best life" | Would rather just live it |
| "It is what it is" | She does say things, but not that—seems empty |
| "Hubby" or "wifey" | No. Never. |
| "Let's unpack that" | Sounds like Instagram therapy |
| "I'm obsessed" (for everything) | Only when she really is |
| "Literally dying" (constantly) | Says it occasionally, not as a crutch |
| "Sorry not sorry" | Seems passive-aggressive |
| "You guys!!!" (excess exclamation marks) | Her enthusiasm doesn't need that many signs |
| "Super unique" | Either it's unique or it's not |
| "Yummy" | She's an adult |
| "Amazeballs" / "Totes" | Please no |
| "Work hard, play hard" | Makes her shudder |

## How She Writes Emails

**Professional:**
- Direct, clear, without excessive pleasantries
- Opens with something specific, not "Hope this finds you well"
- Closes with "Best," or "Thanks," — nothing elaborate
- Reads her emails out loud before sending to make sure they sound right

**Example of her email:**

> Subject: Quick question on the manuscript
>
> Hi Sarah,
>
> Loved the new chapter—the ending really landed.
>
> One thought: the scene with her mother feels slightly rushed. Would you be open to expanding it? I think there's more there.
>
> Let me know what you think. No rush.
>
> Best,
> Margot

**Personal:**
- Almost never sends personal emails—more of a texter
- But if she writes one (to thank for something important, for example), it's thoughtful and specific

## In One Sentence

> **"Speaks like she thinks: clear, with intention, without excess. Her humor is dry and observational. Never says something just to say it. Every word is chosen."**

# Section 10: How She Would React in Specific Situations

This section is your practical tool. When you have a brand decision, ask yourself: **"What would Margot do?"**

## Brand / Product Situations

| Situation | How Margot would react |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Sees a Small Plates ad for the first time** | Stops. Reads. Thinks "okay, this is different." Saves it or sends it to a friend getting married. Doesn't click immediately—processes it first. |
| **Someone explains what Small Plates is** | Understands in the first 10 seconds. If they keep explaining, she gets bored. Wants to know: how does it work? what does it look like? She got the concept already. |
| **Sees the physical book for the first time** | Touches it. Feels the material. Opens it slowly. Reads the names. Gets emotional but doesn't overdo it—a smile, maybe watery eyes. Says "this is really beautiful" and means it. |
| **Receives a Small Plates as a wedding gift** | It's the gift she mentions when someone asks "what was the best gift?" Uses it that same week. Sends a photo to whoever organized it. |
| **Sees a cheesy Small Plates ad** | Eye roll. Ignores it. Thinks "this isn't for me" even though the product is. **The wrong tone loses her even when the product is right.** |
| **Sees an ad trying too hard to be cool** | Also eye roll. Detects when something is trying to be something it's not. Prefers honest to performative. |
| **The recipe collection process is complicated** | Gets frustrated quickly. Doesn't have time for confusing interfaces. If it's not intuitive in 2 minutes, thinks "this should be easier." |
| **Asked to write a recipe for a friend's book** | Does it that week, not in three months. Chooses something meaningful—not her most impressive recipe, the one with a story. Writes a personal note, short but real. |

## Consumption / Purchase Situations

| Situation | How Margot would react |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **A product is beautiful but poorly made** | Doesn't buy it. Aesthetics don't forgive lack of quality. |
| **A product is good but branding is terrible** | Harder to buy. She knows it's superficial but the packaging lives in her house. |
| **Something costs more than expected but is worth it** | Buys it. Doesn't seek cheap, seeks value. Understands the difference. |
| **A brand bombards her with emails** | Immediate unsubscribe. Without guilt. |
| **A brand does something against her values** | Stops buying. Doesn't make a post about it—just leaves. |
| **Discovers a small brand she loves** | Recommends it to everyone. Becomes an evangelist without being paid. |
| **A salesperson is too pushy** | Closes off. Probably doesn't buy even if she was going to. Pressure pushes her away. |
| **A salesperson lets her explore and is available for questions** | Appreciates the space. Probably buys more. |

## Social Situations

| Situation | How Margot would react |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Someone at a party only talks about themselves** | Nods, looks for an elegant exit, goes to get another drink and doesn't come back. |
| **She really likes someone immediately** | Doesn't force it. Lets the connection develop naturally. Maybe suggests meeting again, but without pressure. |
| **A friend cancels last minute** | If it's rare, she understands. If it's a pattern, starts investing less in that friendship. No drama—just adjusts expectations. |
| **Someone gives her a generic gift** | Thanks gracefully. Says nothing negative. But internally notes that person doesn't know her as well as she thought. |
| **Someone gives her a perfect gift** | Remembers forever. Mentions it years later. "Remember when you gave me X? I still have it." |
| **Has to make small talk** | Can do it. Good at it. But looks for the first opportunity to make the conversation real. "So what's actually going on with you?" |
| **Someone is rude to a server** | Says nothing in the moment but registers it. That person drops several points in her mind. Probably no second date or second dinner. |
| **She's at an event where she knows no one** | Uncomfortable at first, but approaches someone who also seems a bit lost. Finds the conversation that's worth it or leaves early. Doesn't pretend she's having fun if she's not. |

## Decision Situations

| Situation | How Margot would react |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Offered an opportunity that sounds good but feels wrong** | Trusts her instinct. Says no. Doesn't need to justify it to anyone. |
| **Has to choose between two good options** | Doesn't get paralyzed. Chooses the one that feels more "her" even if she can't explain why. Trusts her taste. |
| **Made a mistake** | Admits it. Doesn't look for excuses. Learns. Moves on. Doesn't flagellate herself for weeks. |
| **Someone criticizes something she did** | Listens. If the criticism is valid, incorporates it. If not, lets it go. Not all feedback deserves action. |
| **Has to say no to someone** | Says it directly, without long excuses. "I can't, but thank you for thinking of me." Doesn't invent false reasons. |
| **Something she planned goes wrong** | Initial frustration, then adaptation. Doesn't cling to the original plan if it no longer works. Improvises. |

## Wedding-Related Situations

| Situation | How Margot would react |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Sees a wedding that's clearly "for Instagram"** | Finds it a little sad. Smiles, participates, but thinks "I hope they remember the marriage besides the wedding." |
| **Sees a small, intimate, intentional wedding** | Loves it. It's what she wants. Thinks "they get it." |
| **Someone asks if she's having a big wedding** | "Probably not. Just the people who matter." No apologies, no long explanations. |
| **Has to choose a wedding gift** | Never from the generic registry. Thinks about the specific couple. What matters to them? What will they use? What will they remember? |
| **Invited to be a bridesmaid** | If it's a close friend, accepts gladly and takes it seriously. If it's someone she's not that close to, finds an elegant way to decline. |
| **Sees a cheesy wedding product** | Ignores it. Not for her. Doesn't need to criticize it out loud. |
| **Sees a wedding product that's genuinely different** | Stops. Investigates. Considers if she can recommend or use it. |

## The Final Test: Would Margot Approve?

Before any brand decision, pass this test:

| Question | Correct Answer |
|----------|----------------|
| **Would Margot use these words?** | If they sound like generic marketing, no. |
| **Would Margot put this in her apartment?** | If it looks like HomeGoods, no. |
| **Would Margot recommend this to a friend?** | If it would embarrass her, no. |
| **Would Margot like this on Instagram?** | If it's generic or try-hard, no. |
| **Would Margot feel something with this?** | If it's lukewarm, no. |
| **Would Margot trust this brand?** | If it feels fake or exaggerated, no. |
| **Would Margot remember this tomorrow?** | If it's forgettable, no. |

# Closing

Margot Cole isn't real. But she is true.

> **"Would Margot love it, ignore it, or find it cringe?"**

If she'd love it: do it.
