# Brand Feeling

## Small Plates should feel like:
An engraved wedding ring.

Not an object.
A symbol.

Not something you use.
Something you keep.

Not a product.
A marker of a life transition.

Small Plates is not meant to be consumed.
It's meant to be remembered.

It should feel:

- permanent
- symbolic
- personal
- irreplaceable
- intimate
- emotional
- sacred

If it feels disposable, we failed.
If it feels collectible, we failed.
If it feels operational, we failed.

This is not a book.
This is a keepsake.
This is a wedding artifact.

The emotional bar is not:
"nice"
"cute"
"fun"
"cool"

The emotional bar is:
"forever."
