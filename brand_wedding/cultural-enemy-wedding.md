# Cultural Enemy — Weddings (Refined)

## The Forgettable Wedding Gift

Not cheap.
Not wrong.
Not ugly.

Just... forgettable.

Another thing you buy
because you’re supposed to.

Another item that says:
"I showed up"
without saying:
"I know you."

The modern wedding industry
makes it easy to give something —
without making it meaningful.

We stand against:
- gifts without intention
- gestures without memory
- objects without story

Money can buy beauty.

Care builds meaning.

Small Plates is care, made tangible.
