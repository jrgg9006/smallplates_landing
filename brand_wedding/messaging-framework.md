> **Because the best part of a wedding isn't the day. It's the life you build after. And that life happens in the kitchen.**
>
> **Still at the table.**

**The message for her:**

> **This isn't another registry gift that ends up in a closet.**
>
> **It's a cookbook made by the people who showed up to your wedding—their recipes, their notes, their love. Bound into something you'll actually use.**
>
> **Because the wedding isn't the end. It's the beginning.**
>
> **And this book carries your people into the life you're about to build. A reminder, every time you cook, that they're still with you.**
>
> **Not a keepsake. A kitchen book.**
>
> **Still at the table.**

>

**The message for her:**

>
> **Just the glory of being the friend who thought of this.**

---

## 2.4 The Guests

**Who they are:**
- Everyone from grandma to college roommate
- Busy, distracted

**The message for them:**

> **[Bride's name] is getting married. You're invited to the wedding—and now to the book.**

>
> **Doesn't have to be fancy. Just has to be yours.**
>

## 2.5 The Mom (Mother of the Bride)

**Who she is:**

- Wants things to not be cheesy or embarrassing
- Wants to feel like this is for him too, not just "bride stuff"
- Appreciates the practical and the real

**The message for him:**

> **It's a cookbook.**
>
> **Made by your people. With recipes you'll actually make.**
>
> **Not a decoration. Not a keepsake you'll never open. A kitchen book.**
>

|-------------|---------|
| **It's easy** | "No design skills needed. No chasing people. We handle the reminders, the design, the printing." |
| **It's a gift that gets used** | "Not a keepsake that sits on a shelf. A kitchen book that gets stained, dog-eared, and opened every week." |
| **It's personal** | "Every page has a name. A note. A recipe from someone who actually knows them." |
| **It's permanent** | "Hardcover. Professionally printed. Made to last decades, not months." |

# Part 5: Objection Handling

Common doubts and objections from each audience, and how to respond.

---

## Organizer Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"This seems complicated"** | "You invite. They send. We make the book. That's it. No design skills, no chasing people—we send the reminders." |
| **"What if people don't participate?"** | "We send up to 3 reminders per guest. Most books end up with 30-50+ recipes. People want to be part of this." |
| **"How long does it take?"** | "Guests need about 5 minutes to submit. The whole process from start to printed book takes 4-6 weeks." |
| **"Is it expensive?"** | "It's one gift from the group, not per person. Divided among bridesmaids or family, it's less than most registry items—and infinitely more meaningful." |

---

## Guest Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"I don't cook"** | "Perfect. Send the takeout you'd die for. The sandwich you get every time. It's not about being a chef—it's about being in the book." |
| **"I don't have time"** | "5 minutes. Seriously. Pick a recipe, write a note, done." |
| **"My recipe isn't good enough"** | "Doesn't have to be fancy. Your mom's pasta. A frozen pizza hack. The point is it's yours." |
| **"I don't know what to put"** | "What's the one dish you always make? Or always order? Or always bring to parties? That's the one." |

---

## Bride / Couple Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Isn't it just a cookbook?"** | "It's a cookbook made by the people who love you. Every recipe has a name, a note, a story. It's not instructions—it's presence." |
| **"We already have recipes online"** | "The internet doesn't have your grandmother's handwriting. Or your best friend's hangover cure. Or your uncle's terrible joke in the margins." |
| **"Will we actually use it?"** | "It's designed to be used. Hardcover. Lay-flat binding. Made to get stained and dog-eared. This isn't a keepsake—it's a kitchen book." |

---

## Mom Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Is this serious or trendy?"** | "Hardcover. Professionally printed. Made to last decades. This isn't a trend—it's an heirloom." |
| **"Is it appropriate for a wedding?"** | "It's a gift that captures everyone who was there—in something they'll use every day. More meaningful than most traditional gifts." |

---

## Groom Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Sounds cheesy"** | "It's a cookbook. Real recipes. Real food. You'll actually use it on a Tuesday night. Nothing cheesy about that." |
| **"Isn't this just for her?"** | "It's for your kitchen. Your meals. Your people. If you eat, it's for you too." |
