# Part I: The Philosophy

## What Photography Is For Us

Photography is not documentation. It is not memory capture. It is not decoration.

Photography is **storytelling with restraint**.

Every frame I create contains a tension—between what is shown and what is withheld. Between the cool surface and the warm core. Between the contemporary and the timeless.

A photograph that says everything says nothing.
A photograph that holds something back invites the viewer in.

This is the foundation of how I see.

---

## The Governing Principle

> **Cool on the outside. Emotional on the inside.**

This is not just a brand line. It is a visual philosophy.

The surface is:
- Composed
- Restrained
- Editorial
- Elevated

The core is:
- Warm
- Human
- Connected
- Real

My photographs never lead with tears. They earn them.
My photographs never shout. They make you lean in.

---

## The Filter: Margot Cole

Before pressing the shutter, I ask one question:

> "Would Margot frame this in her Cobble Hill apartment?"

Margot is 28. Editorial Director at an independent publishing house. Lives in Brooklyn. Wears neutral tones with one bold detail. Her taste is impeccable but never performative.

If this photograph would make Margot pause—if she'd send it to a friend getting married—if she'd save it without needing to explain why—then it works.

If it feels like a Pinterest board, a stock library, or a greeting card—kill it.

---

## The Three Laws

**Law One: Anonymity Creates Universality**

We never show faces. Ever.

A face belongs to someone specific. A gesture belongs to everyone.

When viewers cannot see who the subjects are, they become the subjects. The bride becomes *every* bride. The couple becomes *their* couple. The moment becomes *their* moment.

Anonymity is not limitation. It is invitation.

**Law Two: Objects Tell Stories**

Hands matter. What hands hold matters more.

A cast iron skillet says: "We will build something together."
A kettle says: "Our home will be warm."
Kitchen tools say: "This marriage will be lived in."

Every object in frame must earn its presence. Every object must speak.

**Law Three: Tension Creates Interest**

Tension is the distance between expectation and reality.

A bride in a suit instead of a gown—tension.
Wedding attire in a garden, not a church—tension.
Elegance holding a cast iron pan—tension.

Without tension, photographs are forgettable. With tension, they become unforgettable.

# Part II: The Color Philosophy

## Primary Palette

### The Warm Neutrals

These are the bones of every image.

| Color | Hex Approximation | Emotional Weight |
|-------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Warm White** | #FAF7F2 | Canvas, breath, possibility |
| **Cream** | #F5F1EB | Softness, heritage, comfort |
| **Sand** | #E8E0D5 | Foundation, earth, permanence |
| **Soft Charcoal** | #2D2D2D | Grounding, text, structure |

### The Story Colors

These create narrative and emotional resonance.

| Color | Hex Approximation | Usage | Emotional Weight |
|-------|-------------------|-------|------------------|
| **Honey** | #D4A854 | Accent, highlight | Joy, warmth, celebration |
| **Terracotta** | #C4856C | Secondary accent | Earth, Italy, timelessness |
| **Olive** | #6B7B5E | Environment | Growth, nature, Mediterranean |
| **Sage/Mint** | #A8C4B8 | Backdrop | Calm, sophistication, freshness |
| **Muted Lavender** | #C8B8D0 | Floral accents | Romance without cliché |

### Absolute Color Rules

**Always:**
- Warm undertones in every shot
- Pastel and muted tones—never saturated
- Colors that feel like they've been softened by golden hour
- Harmony between wardrobe, environment, and props

**Never:**
- Pure black (use Soft Charcoal)
- Pure white (use Warm White or Cream)
- Saturated primary colors
- Cool blue or purple as dominant tones
- Black and white photography
- Blush pink (wedding industry cliché)
- Rose gold (overused)

### The 60-30-10 Rule for Color

Every image follows this ratio:

- **60%**: Neutral foundation (Warm White, Cream, Sand, Sage)
- **30%**: Story color (Terracotta, Olive, Soft Charcoal)
- **10%**: Accent (Honey, strategic color pops)

---

## Color Grading Specifications

### In-Camera Settings

- White balance: Shift toward warm (5500K-6500K)
- Avoid auto white balance (too unpredictable)
- Slight highlight reduction for film-like quality

### Post-Processing Direction

| Adjustment | Direction |
|------------|-----------|
| Temperature | +8 to +15 (warmer) |
| Tint | +3 to +5 (slightly magenta) |
| Highlights | -20 to -35 |
| Shadows | +15 to +25 (lifted blacks) |
| Whites | -10 (soften) |
| Blacks | +8 to +15 (no true black) |
| Saturation | -5 to -15 (muted) |
| Vibrance | +5 to +10 (recover skin tones) |
| Clarity | -5 to +5 (soft, not muddy) |

### The Film Emulation

The goal is not digital perfection. The goal is the quality of memory.

Characteristics to achieve:
- Soft, lifted shadows (no crushed blacks)
- Gentle grain (3-8% depending on image size)
- Slightly faded highlights
- Warm midtones
- Colors that feel developed, not rendered

Reference: Kodak Portra 400, Fujifilm Pro 400H

# Part III: The Light

## The Philosophical Approach to Light

Light is not illumination. Light is emotion made visible.

Harsh light creates anxiety.
Flat light creates boredom.
Directional, warm light creates intimacy.

Every lighting decision should answer: "What does this moment feel like?"

---

## Primary Lighting: The Golden Paradigm

### The Ideal Light

The perfect Small Plates light is:
- **Golden hour quality** — even when it's not golden hour
- **Directional** — sculpting bodies and objects
- **Warm** — 3200K to 4500K color temperature
- **Soft** — never harsh edges on shadows
- **Natural** — or made to appear natural

### Time-of-Day Priorities

| Priority | Time | Quality | When to Shoot |
|----------|------|---------|---------------|
| 1st | 30 min before sunset | Perfect golden, warm, dimensional | Hero shots, emotional moments |
| 2nd | Overcast midday | Soft, even, flattering | Detail shots, versatile work |
| 3rd | Open shade | Soft, slightly cool (adjust in post) | Portraits, group shots |
| 4th | Early morning | Clean, fresh, slight gold | Kitchen scenes, fresh starts |
| Avoid | Harsh midday sun | Hard shadows, squinting, unflattering | Never |

### Natural Light Positioning

The subject should be positioned so that:
- Light comes from 45° to the side, or slightly behind (rim light)
- Face/body is illuminated without harsh shadows
- Background has depth and dimension
- There is separation between subject and background

---

## Secondary Lighting: The Controlled Interior

When natural light is unavailable, we create it.

### The Setup

**Key Light:**
- Large softbox or diffused window simulation
- 45° from camera axis
- Slightly above eye level
- Warm gel (1/4 CTO or 1/8 CTO)

**Fill:**
- Reflector or second soft source
- Opposite key light
- 2:1 or 3:1 ratio (never flat)

**Accent:**
- Rim light or hair light when needed
- Warm (match key)
- Creates separation and dimension

### The Goal

Artificial light must be invisible. If someone can tell you used lighting equipment, you failed.

---

## Light Modifiers and Their Emotional Quality

| Modifier | Emotional Quality | Use For |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Sheer curtains | Dreamy, romantic, soft | Window scenes, bride preparation |
| Silk diffusion | Elegant, editorial, controlled | Product, detail shots |
| Gold reflector | Warm, sunny, joyful | Fill in shade, skin glow |
| White reflector | Clean, natural, subtle | General fill |
| Negative fill (black) | Moody, dimensional, dramatic | When more shadow is needed |

---

## Shadows: The Positive Space

Shadows are not problems to solve. Shadows are tools to use.

Good shadows:
- Create dimension
- Add drama without tension
- Reveal form
- Are soft-edged, never harsh

Bad shadows:
- Fall across faces
- Create harsh lines
- Are so deep they become distracting
- Compete with the subject

The ideal shadow is one you feel but don't notice.

---

# Part IV: Composition

## The Frame as Narrative

Every edge of the frame is a choice. Nothing enters accidentally. Nothing exits carelessly.

The frame contains:
- What I want you to see
- What I want you to feel
- What I want you to wonder about

What lives outside the frame is equally important: the faces, the obvious, the expected.

---

## Primary Composition: The Figure Without Face

### The Crop

For wedding imagery, the standard crop points are:

| Crop Point | What It Includes | What It Excludes | Emotional Effect |
|------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Chest and below** | Hands, body, environment | Face, full shoulders | Most universal, invitational |
| **Shoulders and below** | Upper body, gesture | Face | Slightly more intimate |
| **Hands only** | Fingers, rings, objects | Everything else | Intimate, detail-focused |
| **Full body, face obscured** | Everything except face (hat, position, objects) | Face | Editorial, mysterious |

The chin line is the barrier. Never cross it unless the face is fully obscured.

### Methods of Face Obscuration

When the full figure is in frame:

1. **Accessories** — Wide-brimmed hats, veils, floral arrangements
2. **Position** — Profile with subject looking away, back to camera
3. **Objects** — Holding something that naturally blocks the face
4. **Motion blur** — Movement that softens facial features
5. **Light** — Backlit silhouettes, rim lighting that hides features
6. **Depth of field** — Face outside the focus plane
7. **Framing** — Cropped at the top of frame, cut before face

---

## The Hero Composition Template

Based on the million-dollar image, this is the structure for primary campaign imagery:

### Horizontal (16:9 or 2.39:1 Cinematic)

```
|  Environment  |   Subject(s)   |  Environment  |
|    (plants)   | (center-weight)|    (plants)   |
|   tertiary    |    primary     |   tertiary    |
```

- **Subjects**: Center of frame, occupying 30-40% of width
- **Environment**: Flanking both sides, creating context
- **Negative space**: Above (if cropped at chest) or below (if full body)
- **Balance**: Near-symmetrical but not mathematical

### Vertical (4:5 Instagram or 9:16 Stories)

```
|  Negative/Environment  |
|------------------------|
|       Subject(s)       |
|       (primary)        |
|------------------------|
|  Environment/Objects   |
```

- **Subjects**: Middle third of frame
- **Environment**: Upper and lower context
- **Cropping**: Still excludes face

---

## The Rule of Intentional Imperfection

Perfect symmetry is boring. Perfect composition is sterile.

Introduce intentional imperfection:
- Subjects slightly off-center
- One prop larger than its pair
- Uneven negative space
- One hand slightly higher than the other

This creates visual interest and human quality.

---

## Compositional Elements Hierarchy

### Primary: The Human Figure

The body, the posture, the gesture. This is what we care about.

- Posture should suggest connection, confidence, ease
- Gesture should imply action, relationship, story
- Hands are always visible and always doing something

### Secondary: The Objects

Kitchen items, props, environmental elements that speak.

- Every object must have a reason
- Objects create narrative tension
- Objects connect to the Small Plates story

### Tertiary: The Environment

Setting, background, framing elements.

- Mediterranean garden, New York terrace, real kitchen
- Never studio, never sterile
- Supports without competing

---

## Negative Space

Negative space is not empty. It is breathing room.

Rules for negative space:
- Minimum 15% of frame should be "rest area"
- Negative space should be warm-toned (Warm White, Cream, Sage)
- Negative space creates hierarchy—tells the eye where to go
- More negative space = more editorial feel

---

# Part V: The Subjects

## Wardrobe Philosophy

Wedding attire must be unmistakable but never cliché.

### The Bride

**Yes:**
- Cream, ivory, champagne, soft white
- Suits, jumpsuits, modern gowns, two-piece sets
- Structured tailoring, clean lines
- Editorial fashion that is clearly bridal
- Accessories: straw hats, minimal jewelry, statement earrings
- Fabric: linen, silk, crepe, matte finishes

**No:**
- Traditional ball gowns (unless deconstructed/editorial)
- Heavy lace, excessive beading
- Veils as the only face-obscuring element (too expected)
- Anything that reads "princess bride"
- Extremely casual (could be mistaken for everyday wear)

### The Groom

**Yes:**
- Terracotta, tan, camel, sage, cream, soft navy
- Unstructured blazers, linen suits
- No tie, or loosened tie
- Relaxed elegance, Italian insouciance
- White or cream undershirts visible

**No:**
- Traditional black tuxedo (unless styled unconventionally)
- Matching outfits with bride (too coordinated)
- Extremely casual (polo shirts, shorts)
- Corporate suits

### The Couple Together

The visual harmony comes from:
- Complementary (not matching) color palette
- Similar formality level
- Shared relaxed confidence
- Both clearly wedding-dressed

### Size Inclusivity

All body types are beautiful. Our photography must reflect this.

- Posing guidance adapts to each body
- Lighting flatters, doesn't hide
- Fashion choices work for the individual
- Never suggest subjects need to "slim down"
- Celebrate bodies as they are

---

## Posing Direction

We do not pose. We direct.

### The Difference

Posing: "Put your hand on your hip. Tilt your chin."
Directing: "Hold this as if you just finished cooking and you're about to serve."

Posing creates mannequins. Directing creates moments.

### Direction Phrases That Work

| Desired Outcome | Direction Given |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Natural arm position | "Let your arms hang heavy, like after a long day" |
| Connected but not clingy | "Stand next to each other like you're waiting for a friend" |
| Kitchen object holding | "Hold this like it's yours, like you've used it a hundred times" |
| Confident stance | "Feet planted, like you own this space" |
| Subtle intimacy | "Lean toward each other just slightly, like you're sharing a secret" |
| Movement | "Walk toward me, slowly, like you have all the time in the world" |

### The Golden Pose: Standing Side by Side

This is the hero pose. The signature.

**Structure:**
- Figures stand shoulder-width apart or slightly closer
- Both face forward or at slight angles toward each other
- Weight on back foot (grounded, not eager)
- Arms hang naturally at sides
- Each holds a kitchen object at waist height
- Bodies are relaxed but posture is confident

**What it communicates:**
- Partnership without performance
- Readiness without anxiety
- Connection without desperation
- "We belong here"

---

## Hands and Their Language

Hands are the most expressive element after the face. They must be intentional.

### Hand Positions That Work

| Position | Emotional Read |
|----------|----------------|
| Holding an object naturally | Purpose, competence, comfort |
| Hands touching casually | Connection, intimacy |
| One hand in pocket | Confidence, ease |
| Hands at sides, relaxed | Open, present, ready |
| Holding hands (not intertwined) | Partnership, solidarity |
| Preparing/cooking action | Collaboration, shared life |

### Hand Positions to Avoid

| Position | Why Avoid |
|----------|-----------|
| Hands hidden | Feels closed, suspicious |
| Gripping too tightly | Tension, anxiety |
| Awkward placement | Distracting |
| Jazz hands/fingers spread | Performative, unnatural |
| Clasped in front formally | Too stiff, corporate |

---

# Part VI: The Environment

## Location Selection Criteria

Every location must pass three tests:

1. **Would Margot go here?** — Is it her aesthetic? Her world?
2. **Does it feel Mediterranean-New York?** — Warmth meets sophistication
3. **Does it allow anonymity?** — Can we obscure faces naturally?

### A-Tier Locations

| Location Type | Why It Works | Considerations |
|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Mediterranean garden | Terracotta, olive trees, sage | Needs warm light, avoid midday |
| Brooklyn brownstone terrace | New York energy, urban sophistication | Limited space, require permits |
| Real, lived-in kitchen | Authentic, on-brand | Must be aesthetically aligned |
| Vineyard/olive grove | Romantic, European, timeless | Travel required, seasonal |
| Outdoor dinner table setting | Community, sharing, celebration | Needs proper prop styling |

### B-Tier Locations (Use Carefully)

| Location Type | Caution |
|---------------|---------|
| Formal venue | Risk of "too wedding" |
| Restaurant kitchen | Can feel commercial |
| Rooftop | NYC cliché if not styled well |

### Never

| Location Type | Why Never |
|---------------|-----------|
| Church interior | Too traditional, expected |
| Generic hotel | Sterile, brand-conflicting |
| Beach | Wedding cliché |
| Studio with seamless | Cold, commercial |

---

## Prop Selection and Styling

### The Prop Philosophy

Every prop must be able to answer: "Why are you here?"

If a prop cannot answer, it does not belong.

### Kitchen Objects — The Primary Props

These are sacred. They connect to the Small Plates story.

| Object | What It Says | Styling Notes |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| Cast iron skillet | Heritage, craft, permanence | Seasoned, not new |
| Kettle (classic style) | Home, warmth, daily ritual | Enamel or copper preferred |
| Wooden cutting board | Preparation, collaboration | Worn edges, used look |
| Ceramic bowls | Handmade, artisanal, shared | Matte finish, earth tones |
| Linen napkins | Texture, refinement | Cream, white, sage |
| Bread | Abundance, breaking bread | Rustic loaves, torn edges |
| Wine (glasses/bottles) | Celebration, sophistication | Minimal branding visible |
| Fresh produce | Life, kitchen, nourishment | Imperfect, real, not styled |

### Environmental Props

| Object | Usage | Styling Notes |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Terracotta pots | Frame subjects, add warmth | Various sizes, aged |
| Plants (olive, rosemary, lavender) | Mediterranean reference, life | Real plants preferred |
| Floral arrangements | Soft romance, natural beauty | Muted tones, loose arrangements |
| Straw hats | Fashion element, face obscuring | Wide-brimmed, natural |
| Baskets | Rustic, functional beauty | Woven, neutral tones |
| Candles | Warmth, intimacy (for evening) | Pillar or taper, never jarred |

### Prop Color Rules

Props should follow the palette:
- Terracotta, olive, cream, sage, honey tones
- Avoid bright colors, neon, primary colors
- Natural materials (wood, ceramic, linen, rattan)
- No plastic, no high-gloss finishes

---

# Part VII: Technical Specifications

## Camera Settings

### The Foundation Settings

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Aperture | f/2.8 - f/4 | Shallow depth for subject separation while maintaining sharpness on both subjects |
| ISO | Native to 800 | Clean files with room to add grain in post |
| Shutter | 1/125 - 1/500 | Freeze movement, allow handheld |
| Format | RAW always | Maximum editing flexibility |
| Aspect Ratio | Capture 3:2 or 4:3, crop in post | Flexibility for different deliverables |

### For Different Scenarios

| Scenario | Aperture | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Hero couple shot | f/3.2 - f/4 | Both subjects sharp, background soft |
| Hand detail | f/2 - f/2.8 | Extreme shallow focus |
| Environmental | f/5.6 - f/8 | More in focus, context matters |
| Movement | f/4, higher shutter | Freeze action |

---

## Lens Selection

### Primary Lenses

| Lens | Use Case | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 50mm | Couples, standard work | Natural perspective, versatile |
| 85mm | Detail, compression | Flattering, beautiful separation |
| 35mm | Environmental portraits | Context, sense of place |

### Secondary/Specialty

| Lens | Use Case | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 24mm | Wide environmental | Show complete scene |
| 105mm macro | Extreme details | Texture, small objects |

### Lens Quality

All lenses should produce:
- Soft, smooth bokeh
- Minimal distortion
- Warm rendering (not clinical)
- Gentle vignetting (embrace it)

---

## Focal Length and Their Emotional Quality

| Focal Length | Emotional Quality | Best For |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| 24mm | Environmental, immersive, slightly surreal | Wide scene-setting |
| 35mm | Documentary, intimate, present | Kitchen scenes, environment |
| 50mm | Natural, honest, neutral | Default choice |
| 85mm | Romantic, flattering, dreamy | Couples, details |
| 105-135mm | Compressed, editorial, magazine-like | High-end portraits, compression |

---

## Depth of Field Choices

### Sharp Focus

The subject (hands, body, key props) must always be sharp.

### Soft Focus

Backgrounds should gently fall away—never harshly out of focus, never distractingly sharp.

### Focus Point Selection

| Subject | Focus On |
|---------|----------|
| Single figure | Nearest hand or primary object |
| Two figures | Midpoint between them, or nearest figure's shoulder |
| Detail shot | Point of interest (ring, texture, object) |

---

# Part VIII: The Shot List Framework

## For Any Session: The Required Shots

Every photo session must deliver these categories:

### 1. The Hero (1-3 shots)

The signature image. Two figures, kitchen objects, no faces, editorial styling.
This is the "million-dollar image."

- Horizontal composition
- Center-weighted subjects
- Environmental framing
- Full 60-30-10 color ratio

### 2. The Detail Close-ups (5-10 shots)

Hands, objects, textures that tell the story.

- Rings on hands
- Kitchen objects being held
- Fabric textures
- Props in context

### 3. The Environmental (3-5 shots)

The scene, the setting, the world we're in.

- Wide shots showing location
- Subjects smaller in frame
- Context-heavy compositions

### 4. The Movement (2-5 shots)

Life, energy, action.

- Subjects walking toward or away
- Hands in motion
- Slight blur for energy

### 5. The Intimate (2-5 shots)

The quieter moments.

- Hands nearly touching
- Subtle lean toward each other
- Close proximity without clinch

# Part IX: The Review Process

## The Seven-Point Quality Check

Before any image is approved, it must pass all seven points:

| # | Question | Required Answer |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Is every face invisible or fully obscured? | Yes |
| 2 | Do the colors match the palette? | Yes |
| 3 | Is the light warm and directional? | Yes |
| 4 | Would Margot save this image? | Yes |
| 5 | Does it feel Mediterranean-New York? | Yes |
| 6 | Is there narrative tension? | Yes |
| 7 | Does it feel alive, not staged? | Yes |

If any answer is "No," the image requires revision or rejection.

---

## Common Rejection Reasons

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Face visible | Recrop, reshoot, or use different frame |
| Colors too cool | Warm in post, add orange to highlights |
| Lighting flat | Add contrast in post, use directional dodge/burn |
| Feels stock | Reassess composition, add narrative element |
| Too posed | Redirect subjects, capture in-between moments |
| Wrong props | Remove, replace, reshoot |
| Environment distracting | Simplify background, add blur, recrop |

---

## The Final Test

Hold the image at arm's length. Ask:

1. **Does it stop me?** — If you scroll past, it fails.
2. **Does it intrigue me?** — If you understand everything immediately, it fails.
3. **Do I want to know more?** — If you feel complete without context, it fails.
4. **Does it feel expensive?** — If it feels cheap or generic, it fails.
5. **Would I put this on a wall?** — If it's purely functional, it fails.

---

# Part X: The Inspiration

## The Visual Ancestors

These are the shoulders we stand on:

### Photographers

**Sarah Falugo** — For her effortless Italian weddings, film quality, human warmth
**John and Joseph** — For their editorial fashion meets real emotion
**Luis Ibáñez** — For Mediterranean light and color
**Kinfolk Magazine (early years)** — For the gathering table, the community, the simple luxury

### Films

**Call Me By Your Name** — Italian light, summer color, longing
**The Talented Mr. Ripley** — Mediterranean sophistication, tension beneath surface
**Frances Ha** — New York energy, black and white heart in color world
**Marie Antoinette (Coppola)** — Pastel palette, fashion as emotion, modern in period

### Other References

**La Dolce Vita** — The aspiration, the beauty, the bittersweet
**Bon Appétit (2015-2020)** — Kitchen as stage, people as stars, food as connection
**Sunday Suppers** — The communal table, the belonging

---

## The Feeling In One Frame

If I could only capture one image to represent Small Plates, it would be:

> Two people standing in a garden at golden hour. Both dressed beautifully—clearly for a wedding, but not traditionally. They face forward, close but not touching. Each holds a kitchen object as if it were the most natural thing in the world. We cannot see their faces. We don't need to. Their presence, their stance, their objects—they tell us everything. This is a marriage that will be lived in. A kitchen that will be full. A table where people will gather. We don't see their faces because they could be anyone. They could be us.

This is what every image aspires to.
