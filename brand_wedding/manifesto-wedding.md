# Brand Manifesto — Weddings

We live in a world that made gift-giving easy.
Too easy.

Click. Ship. Done.
A registry. A box. A thing.

But somewhere along the way,
we stopped giving pieces of ourselves.

We believe food is the most human way to connect.

Not just something we make —
something we give.

Recipes aren't instructions.
They're stories. Memories. Pieces of a life
passed from one hand to another.

We believe the things we keep in our homes should matter.
They should remind us of who we are.
And who showed up.

That's Small Plates.

A book made by the people who love you.
A kitchen filled with their voices.
A table that remembers.

Every page holds a name.
A note.
A reason to cook together.

Not for perfect meals.
For full ones.

Because in the end,
it was never about the food.

It's about the people.
The laughter.
The life you build around the table.

This is what we protect.
This is what we keep.
This is what we pass on.
