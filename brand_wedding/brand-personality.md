# SMALL PLATES — BRAND PERSONALITY

## The Feeling

Small Plates feels like **belonging**.

Not escape.  
Not rebellion.  
Not freedom from something.

But:

A place you return to.  
People who know you.  
A kitchen with history.  
A table that remembers.  
A home that holds you.

Small Plates isn’t about leaving something behind.  
It’s about building something that stays.

It feels like being known.  
Being included.  
Being quietly loved.

It’s a brand that reminds the bride this wedding isn’t just a day…

It’s the first page of a life.

## Where Small Plates Lives

Small Plates lives in the kitchen.

It's a book that smells like fresh ink
and tastes like the hands of people who love you.

It's your best friend's grandmother's recipe.
Your brother's favorite dish.
The dessert your mother never wrote down —
but now exists forever.

It's not a gift you display.
It's a gift you use.
It's not a memory you frame.
It's a memory you eat.

Small Plates turns a wedding into a table.
And a table into a home.

## If Small Plates Were a Person

Small Plates would be a **28-year-old woman** with New York energy.

She arrives at a wedding **smiling and sure of herself** —  
not trying to be the center of attention,  
but somehow you always notice when she’s there.

She wears:

- a long dress, minimal but intentional  
- neutral tones with one bold detail (a strap, a back, a texture, a piece of jewelry)  
- natural makeup that still feels polished  
- heels because she loves feeling elevated, not to suffer

She feels like:

- champagne on a terrace at night  
- jazz/soul or soft house playing low in the background  
- a late dinner with people you actually like  
- something you want in your home for a long time

## Who We Are

Small Plates is not “a brand”.  
It’s **the right friend**.

The one with good taste.  
The one who doesn’t improvise when it matters.  
The one who dares to suggest something different.  
The one who protects the details.  
The one who takes care of things calmly.  
The one who solves without making it heavy.

She isn’t the loudest in the room,  
but people listen when she speaks.

She is not rigid.  
Not cheesy.  
Not childish.  
Not ceremonial.

She is:

- secure  
- emotional without being uncomfortable  
- cool without being hollow  
- free without being chaotic

## Our Core Personality

Small Plates lives exactly here:

> **Emotion at the core. Cool on the surface.**

Or:

> **A brand with social soul and editorial standards.**

It feels light on the outside  
and meticulous on the inside.

It is:

- creative without being messy  
- emotional without being sentimental  
- elegant without being cold  
- bold without being reckless  
- modern without being disposable  
- feminine without being cliché  
- premium without being arrogant  

Small Plates doesn’t shout luxury.  
It simply feels like it.

## How We Behave

Small Plates doesn’t pressure decisions.  
It makes them feel natural.

We don’t rush.  
We don’t push.  
We don’t speak like an industry.

We speak like a person.

We don’t dramatize emotion.  
We don’t minimize what matters.

We never make anyone feel:

- awkward  
- excessive  
- cheesy  
- uncomfortable  
- out of place  

Our presence should always lower stress — never raise it.

---

## Emotional Range

Small Plates knows how to be:

- warm without being soft  
- playful without being silly  
- intimate without being invasive  
- elegant without being distant  
- vulnerable without being weak  
- confident without being harsh  

The brand can be:

- soft  
- witty  
- honest  
- shy when needed  
- brave when it matters  

Never artificial.

---

## What We Are Not

Small Plates is NOT:

- a “wedding brand”  
- a quick-gift brand  
- a cheesy brand  
- a childish brand  
- a traditional brand  
- a cluttered brand  
- a fake aspirational brand  
- a Pinterest brand  
- a quote-machine brand  
- a performative brand  

It is also not a wedding planner,  
or a stationery company.

It is an emotional editorial brand.

## Our Sense of Humor

We don’t force jokes.  
We don’t speak corporate.

Our humor is observational.  
Smart.  
Light.

More:  
> “I know exactly what you’re feeling.”

Less:  
> “I’m trying to sell you something.”

---

## Cultural Role

Small Plates exists to say:

Not every gift has to be useful.  
Not every memory has to be practical.  
Not everything has to be optimized.

Some things are meant only to be felt —  
and kept close.

---

## Final Definition

Small Plates is:

> **The cool friend with high standards.**

Or:

> **The friend who does things right…  
> with soul.**

---

## The North-Star Check

When in doubt, we ask:

> “Is this what our 28-year-old New York friend,  
> champagne-in-hand on a terrace at night,  
> would do for someone she truly loves?”

If the answer is no,  
we don’t do it.

If the answer is yes,  
we do it —  
beautifully.
