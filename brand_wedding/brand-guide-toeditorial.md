# 1. WHO WE ARE

## The Product

Small Plates creates **collaborative recipe books for weddings**. Guests contribute recipes, and we transform them into a hardcover cookbook for the couple.

**The promise:** "Recipes from the people who love you."

**The brand idea:** "Still at the table."

## The Essence

> **"Cool on the outside. Emotional on the inside."**

The book should look sophisticated and editorial on the outside. But when you open it, it should move you.

We don't lead with tears — we earn them.

## The Feeling

Small Plates feels like **belonging**.

A place you return to.
People who know you.
A kitchen with history.
A table that remembers.
A home that holds you.

Small Plates isn't about escaping something.
It's about building something that stays.

# 2. OUR MANIFESTO

We live in a world that made gift-giving easy.
Too easy.

Click. Ship. Done.
A registry. A box. A thing.

But somewhere along the way,
we stopped giving pieces of ourselves.

**We believe food is the most human way to connect.**

Not just something we make —
something we give.

Recipes aren't instructions.
They're stories. Memories. Pieces of a life
passed from one hand to another.

**We believe the things we keep in our homes should matter.**
They should remind us of who we are.
And who showed up.

That's Small Plates.

A book made by the people who love you.
A kitchen filled with their voices.
A table that remembers.

Every page holds a name.
A note.
A reason to cook together.

Not for perfect meals.
For full ones.

Because in the end,
it was never about the food.

It's about the people.
The laughter.
The life you build around the table.

**This is what we protect.**
**This is what we keep.**
**This is what we pass on.**

# 3. OUR CULTURAL ENEMY

## The Forgettable Wedding Gift.

Not cheap.
Not wrong.
Not ugly.

Just... forgettable.

Another thing you buy
because you're supposed to.

Another item that says:
"I showed up"
without saying:
"I know you."

The modern wedding industry
makes it easy to give something —
without making it meaningful.

**We stand against:**
- Gifts without intention
- Gestures without memory
- Objects without story

Money can buy beauty.
**Care builds meaning.**

# 4. OUR PERSONALITY: MARGOT COLE

Every brand decision passes through this question:

> *"Would our 28-year-old New York woman, champagne in hand on a rooftop, say this?"*

If she'd roll her eyes → rewrite.
If she'd say it with a knowing smile → ship it.

## Who Margot Is

Margot Cole is a **28-year-old woman** with New York energy. In her day-to-day, she works at an independent publishing house as Editorial Director. She's not famous, not an influencer, doesn't need people to know who she is. But in her world—books, culture, ideas—people respect her. She has good taste. She knows what will work before it works. Her job is discovering voices and turning them into something people want to read.

**She feels like:**
- Champagne on a terrace at night
- Jazz or soft house playing low in the background
- A late dinner with people you actually like
- Something you want in your home for a long time

## How Margot Behaves

- Doesn't pressure decisions — makes them feel natural
- Doesn't rush, doesn't push
- Speaks like a person, not like an industry
- Never makes anyone feel awkward or out of place
- Her presence lowers stress — never raises it

## What Margot Hates

- Weddings that feel like an Instagram production
- Generic gifts that show they don't know you
- Things made without care
- The pressure to document everything
- People who criticize everything but do nothing

# 5. OUR VOICE

## How We Sound

Small Plates sounds like the friend who always knows.

Knows the restaurant you should try.
Knows the song you'll love before you hear it.
Knows when to push and when to let it be.

She doesn't explain herself.
She doesn't over-sell.
She just says it — and you trust her.

Not loud. Not quiet.
Just... certain.

## The Four Principles

### 1. Warm, With Edge
We care. Genuinely. But we're not soft about it.
Warmth doesn't mean gentle — it means present, real, human.

| We sound like | We don't sound like |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Someone who actually knows you | A greeting card |
| A friend, not a brand | Customer service |
| Honest | Someone trying too hard to be liked |

### 2. Direct, Not Blunt
We say what we mean. First sentence. No warmup.
But direct doesn't mean cold — it means we respect your time.

| We sound like | We don't sound like |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Someone confident in what they're saying | A press release |
| Efficient without being cold | A legal disclaimer |
| Clear, even about emotional things | Using ten words when three would do |

### 3. Effortless, Not Lazy
We make it look easy. That's the skill.
The writing flows. The rhythm feels natural. But underneath, every word is chosen.

| We sound like | We don't sound like |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Someone naturally good with words | Overly casual or sloppy |
| Cool without trying | Trying to be "relatable" |
| Smart without showing off | Like we didn't care enough to edit |

### 4. Moving, Not Pushing
We create momentum. We make people want to act.
But we never pressure. Never guilt. Never fake urgency.

| We sound like | We don't sound like |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Someone sharing something good | A salesperson |
| Excited, not desperate | An alarm clock |
| Confident the product speaks for itself | Someone who needs you to say yes |

# 8. QUICK RULES

## Do's

- **Start strong.** First sentence earns the second.
- **End with momentum.** Last line should make them want to act or feel.
- **Use "you."** We're talking to someone, not at them.
- **Be specific.** "Your mom's pasta" > "a family recipe."
- **Make it easy.** Reduce friction in language.
- **Sound certain.** "This is good" > "We think you'll like this."
- **Mix short and long.** Rhythm matters.
- **Read it out loud.** If it sounds like a brand, rewrite.

## Don'ts

- **Don't hedge.** No "maybe," "perhaps," "we think."
- **Don't over-explain.** Trust the reader.
- **Don't use exclamation points.** Almost never. Confidence doesn't shout.
- **Don't start with "We're excited..."** We're not a press release.
- **Don't be passive.** Even emotional moments have forward motion.
- **Don't guilt or pressure.** Energy yes, anxiety no.
- **Don't use emojis.** Exception: Stories, sparingly.

# 9. THE GUT CHECK

Before publishing anything, ask two questions:

**Question 1:**
> "Would our 28-year-old New York woman, champagne in hand on a rooftop, say this?"

If she'd roll her eyes → rewrite.
If she'd say it with a knowing smile → ship it.

**Question 2:**
> "Does this make someone want to do something?"

Not pressure. Not guilt. *Want.*

If the answer is no → add momentum.
If the answer is yes → you're good.

## The Formula — One Last Time

> **Cool on the outside. Emotional on the inside.**

The surface: confident, stylish, effortless, moving.
The core: deeply human, genuinely caring, real.

We don't lead with tears.
We earn them.

We don't beg for action.
We make people want to move.

We're the friend with the good idea,
the one who shows up with the plan,
the one who makes things happen
without making it feel heavy.

**That's how Small Plates sounds.**
