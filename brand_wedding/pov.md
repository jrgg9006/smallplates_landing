# Brand POV

We believe weddings are not about the event.

They’re about the people.

Photos freeze faces.
We preserve presence.

Others capture how it looked.
We capture who showed up.

We don’t celebrate the day.
We carry the love around it.

A recipe from everyone who matters.
A book dor the kitchen you’ll build together.

Small Plates doesn’t document a wedding.

It holds it.
