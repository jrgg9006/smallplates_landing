Small Plates is not just:
- a cookbook
- a gift
- an activity
- a photo book

We live where two things meet:

1. A one-time shared ritual before the wedding that connects guests and the bride 
2. A physical book that lives in the couple’s kitchen

The ritual:
friends and family sharing their recipes
as a way of saying:
"I want to be present in your new home."

The book:
a wedding keepsake they can actually cook from.

We call this:

A collaborative wedding recipe book.

It’s not something you scroll.
It’s not something you use once and store away.

It’s an experience that ends in a book.
And a book that keeps the experience alive.
